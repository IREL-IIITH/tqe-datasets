Polling for Gurdaspur Lok Sabha bypoll underway
Gurdaspur ( Pb ) , Oct 11 ( PTI ) .
Polling for the high - stakes Gurdaspur Lok Sabha bypoll was underway here today in which the Congress is hoping to consolidate its position and the BJP trying to regain its lost ground .
The seat , which fell vacant following the death of actor - turned - politician Vinod Khanna of the BJP in April , is witnessing a three - cornered race among Congress , BJP and AAP contestants .
While the Congress has fielded its Punjab unit chief Sunil Jakhar , the BJP has fielded businessman Swaran Salaria .
The AAP has placed bet on Major General ( retd ) Suresh Khajuria .
Voters could be seen standing in queues at various polling booths in the morning for voting .
As many as 15.22 lakh voters are eligible to exercise their franchise in the by - election being fought by 11 candidates .
Of the total electorate of 15,22,922 in the constituency , 7,12,077 are women and 14 belong to a third gender , official said .
Around 30 companies of paramilitary forces and more than 7,000 Punjab Police personnel have been deployed in the constituency .
The voting on the parliamentary seat started at 8 am and will go on till 5 pm .
A total of 1,781 polling stations have been set up at 1,257 locations , of which 457 have been declared vulnerable and 83 critical .
Voter - verified paper audit trail ( VVPAT ) will be used at all polling stations .
Votes will be counted on October 15 and the result will be declared the same day , the official said .
Gurdaspur Lok Sabha bypoll is being seen as a barometer for the popularity of the six - month - old Congress government in Punjab .
The bypoll will gauge the popularity of the Amarinder Singh government which is battling allegations of reneging on its pre - assembly polls promise of farm debt waiver and free smart phones .
The Congress , which had bagged 77 seats in the 117 - member Punjab Assembly in February , is keen to keep the winning momentum going .
The BJP has also tried pulling out all the stops to retain the seat , which Khanna had won four times .
A victory would give much - needed boost to the BJP , which had bagged just one segment of Sujanpur out of the four seats it had contested in the assembly polls .
The AAP , the main opposition party in Punjab with 20 seats in the House , is also looking to strengthen its presence in the state .
The Gurdaspur Lok Sabha seat has nine assembly segments - - Bhoa , Pathankot , Gurdaspur , Dinanagar , Qadian , Fathegarh Churian , Dera Baba Nanak , Sujanpur and Batala .
The Election Commission has allowed the use of alternative identity cards for the by - poll .

21 dead in ' catastrophic ' California wildfires
Santa Rosa ( US ) , Oct 12 ( AFP ) .
More than 200 fire engines and firefighting crews from around the country were being rushed to California to help battle infernos which have left at least 21 people dead and thousands homeless .
" This is a serious , critical , catastrophic event , " California fire chief Ken Pimlott told reporters .
" We're not going to be out of the woods for a great number of days to come . "
Pimlott said that after a respite on Tuesday winds were kicking up again yesterday and the winds and dry conditions were hampering efforts to contain the blazes .
" We are still impacted by five years of drought , " the director of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection ( Cal Fire ) said .
" These fires were driven by the critically dry fuel bed , " he added .
" We are literally looking at explosive vegetation . "
Pimlott said the death toll from the fires - - among the deadliest ever in California - - had risen to 21 and could be expected to go up further .
Eleven of the deaths have occurred in Sonoma County , a wine - producing region which has been particularly hard hit , while six people have died in Mendocino County .
There have been two deaths in Napa County and two in Yuba County .
Entire neighborhoods in Santa Rosa , a city of 175,000 which is the county seat of Sonoma County , have been reduced to ashes .
Thousands of people have been left homeless and 25,000 people have evacuated their homes in Sonoma County alone to escape , according to officials .
More than 3,500 homes and businesses have been destroyed including several wineries in Sonoma and Napa counties , the heart of the state's wine production .
Six hundred people have been reported missing in Sonoma County , but more than half of them have been located , Sheriff Robert Giordano told reporters .
" There's still 285 on our missing list that we're looking for , " he said .
Pimlott said firefighters were battling a total of 22 wildfires that have burned over 170,000 acres ( 68,800 hectares ) and that reinforcements had been requested .
He said 170 fire engines had been ordered from the neighbouring states of Arizona , Nevada , Oregon and Washington and another 154 engines from elsewhere around the country .
In addition , 60 firefighting crews from other states were on their way to California to provide assistance , he said .
" Our primary goal is to get these resources into the fires , " Pimlott said .
He said 73 helicopters , 30 air tankers and nearly 8,000 firefighters were currently taking part in the effort to extinguish the blazes .
President Donald Trump has declared a major disaster in California , freeing up federal funding and resources to help fight the fires .
And Governor Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency in eight counties .
Bob Nelson , 53 , stopped in his black pickup truck at a police roadblock near Santa Rosa , said he fled his home on Sunday and returned on Tuesday .
" There was no damage , " he said .
" But then we got evacuated again .
" We don't know about our house now , " Nelson told AFP .
" I've got no idea .
It's in the middle of two fires . "
Michael Desmond , 63 , does know , and the news is bad : his home was one of hundreds destroyed by the blaze in the Coffey Park neighborhood of Santa Rosa .
" I feel violated ; like a thief came in , " said Desmond , who sobbed as he surveyed the rubble of the house where he grew up .
Much of the damage in Santa Rosa can be seen from US Route 101 , the north - south highway which runs from California through Oregon to Washington state .
The Sonoma County Hilton perched on a hill overlooking Route 101 is a ruin of charred wood and twisted metal , as is the nearby Fountaingrove Inn .
An enormous K - Mart store has been entirely destroyed with only a couple of blackened walls still standing .
Among the wineries which reportedly suffered damage were William Hill Estate Winery in Napa , Signorello Vineyards , Stags ' Leap and Chimney Rock .
Forest fires are common in the western United States during dry , hot months but , with 21 deaths so far , this year's California fires are among the deadliest ever .
The Griffith Park fire in Los Angeles County in 1933 killed at least 29 people and 25 people died in the 1991 Oakland Hills fire .

Trump says ' something has to be done ' on North Korea
Washington , Oct 12 ( PTI ) .
US President Donald Trump has said that he has a different approach on North Korea's recent missile and nuclear tests , asserting that the problem has reached a point where " something has to be done " .
North Korea has fired 22 missiles , including two across Japan , during 15 tests since February this year , drawing a sharp reaction from the US and its allies .
" I think I might have a somewhat different attitude and a different way than other people .
I think perhaps I feel stronger and tougher on that subject than other people , but I listen to everybody , " Trump told reporters in a joint media appearance with visiting Canadian Prime Minister Justine Trudeau at his Oval Office yesterday .
" Ultimately , I will do what is right for the United States and really , what is right for the world .
Because that is really a world problem ; that is beyond just the United States , " he said .
Responding to a question , the US president said it is a problem that has to be solved .
Later at night , Trump told Fox News that the world has reached a situation on North Korea where something has to be done .
" This should have been handled 25 years ago , it should have been handled 20 years ago , and 10 years ago , and five years ago , " he said .
" It should have been handled by numerous ?
not just ( former US president Barack ) Obama , but certainly president Obama should have taken care of it .
Now it is at a point where it is very , very far advanced .
Something has to be done .
We can not allow this to happen , " Trump said .
Meanwhile Republican Congressman Ted Yoho told CNN that the goal is to put sanctions on North Korea , have the world buy into it , bring them to the negotiating table , and get a diplomatic end to this .
" All North Korea has to do is look at the satellites at night and compare South Korea to North Korea .
You can see what a democracy and a market economy does , and you can contrast that with Vietnam , who we were at war with , with the Vietnam War .
They embraced market economies .
" They are a communist state , but they are our 16th largest trading partners , " Yoho said .
" Neither country has a nuclear weapon .
So nuclear weapons is not the answer .
Economic trade and let's work on those things that we can agree on and then put the nuclear weapons away , " he added .
The Trump administration along with the UN has been at the forefront of a drive to impose economic sanctions on the globally isolated North Korean regime for its nuclear ambitions which have threatened the world peace .
Trump has engaged in an escalating war of words with North Korean dictator Kim Jong - Un amid rising tensions between the two countries .
Trump has even said that diplomatic efforts have not worked in dealing with North Korea .
Take decisions to make economic recovery sustainable : IMF chief to policymakers
Lalit K Jha
Washington , Oct 13 ( PTI ) .
IMF chief Christine Lagarde today called on the policymakers to take benefit of the global broad - based economic recovery - - the best in a decade - - and take decisions with an aim to make the recovery " sustainable " .
" Our suggestion is that it is not time to be complacent ; it is time to take those policy decisions that will actually enable more people and more countries to benefit from that recovery that should be made sustainable , " Lagarde told reporters at a news conference here at the start of the annual meeting of the IMF and the World Bank .
" And that is the question that we will put to the policymakers , to the finance ministers , and to the governors of the central banks who will be attending the meetings , " she said .
Noting that the recovery was stronger and much more broad - based than in the recent years , Lagarde said the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) expects higher global growth this year ( 3.6 per cent ) and in the next ( 3.7 percent ) .
" So in both the cases , 0.1 percentage points higher than our July projection and certainly much higher than the 3.2 growth that we had in 2016 , " she said .
" What has not changed , though , is that the recovery is not complete , " Lagarde warned .
Last year , 47 countries experienced negative growth on a per capita basis , including many small and fragile economies .
" Far too many people across all types of economies are seeing their aspirations limited by the impact of technology and the repercussions of excessive income inequality , " the IMF boss said .
" The result is growing political tensions in many places and increased skepticism about the benefits of globalisation , " she said .
Proposing her policy agenda , Lagarde said the first priority should be to secure the recovery .
" This includes monetary policy that continues to support the recovery while also recognising risks created by easy finance conditions .
And that is a subtle balancing act which will be determined by the situation of the country based on the independence of the banks and their mandate , " she said .
On the fiscal front , the IMF chief advised the countries to make investments in critical areas like infrastructure , education , and allowing women to access the labor market .
" Other countries should use this moment of better and stronger recovery to reduce public debt relative to GDP , " she said .
Lagarde said the structural reforms will vary from country to country and will be based on reform of the labor market , reform of access to the service markets , removing the rents that sometimes cripple those markets , removing barriers .
" Many of those challenges actually cut across borders , " she said , underscoring the need to make progress on a range of issues including fighting corruption , tackling climate change , and improving the global trading system .
" Fostering this kind of cooperation is the way that we can best serve our 189 member countries in order to help them build a more inclusive , more resilient global economy , " she said .

Srinagar , Oct 14 ( PTI ) .
A top Lashkar - e - Taiba militant , Waseem Shah , believed to be the main architect of unrest last year in south Kashmir , was killed along with his accomplice in an encounter early this morning by the security forces in Pulwama district , police said .
Shah , 23 , also known as ' Abu Osama Bhai ' was killed at Litter area in Pulwama , a place considered to be a safe haven for militants .
This is the first counter - insurgency operation in Litter area in four years .
Jammu and Kashmir police has been tracking the movements of Shah , who is considered as the ' don of Heff ' , another traditional stronghold of militants in South Kashmir's Shopian district .
He was found at a hideout at Litter and police and its special operation group team cordoned off the area , police said .
Shah along with his bodyguard Nisar Ahmed Mir made an attempt to flee the area but could not penetrate the cordon which had been strengthened by the presence of CRPF and Army , they said .
Shah , who was wanted in various terror - related cases , was killed along with Naseer , another local boy who had joined militancy in May this year .
A college dropout , Shah , a resident of Heff - Shrimal in Shopian , joined militancy in 2014 and was considered as the ' chief architect ' of last year's unrest in various parts of South Kashmir .
Born in a middle class family of Gul Mohammed Shah , who ran his fruit business , Shah was an active supporter of Lashkar - e - Taiba militant group since his school days and had doubled up as a courier boy for the outfit , police said .
Off late , Shah , who carried a cash reward of Rs 10 lakh on his head , was recruiting fresh cadres for the militant outfit .

Arvind Kejriwal's missing Wagon R found abandoned in Ghaziabad
New Delhi , Oct 14 ( PTI ) .
Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's creaky blue Wagon R , which was stolen from outside the Delhi Secretariat two days ago , has been found abandoned in Ghaziabad , the police said today .
The humble hatchback , Kejriwal drove around in his early political career and which helped cement his position as the " aam aadmi " , was being used by an AAP functionary before it was stolen .
The Delhi Police said their counterparts in Ghaziabad got in touch with them regarding the car .
" A blue Wagon R has been found abandoned by Ghaziabad police and we think it is the chief minister's car , " said a senior police officer .
The police are verifying its engine and chassis numbers .
Kejriwal had yesterday written a letter to Lt Governor Anil Baijal , saying the theft points towards the rapidly " deteriorating " law and order situation in the national capital .
The incident had outraged AAP workers , many of whom posted videos of Kejriwal using the car , especially on Republic Day in 2014 , after he became the chief minister of Delhi for the first time .
The car was witness to two assembly election wins in 2013 and 2015 and also to the party's poor performance in the Lok Sabha polls .
It was " donated " to Kejriwal by Kundan Sharma , a software engineer , in January 2013 .
However , when Kejriwal parted ways with his then party colleagues Prashant Bhushan and Yogendra Yadav , Sharma demanded that the vehicle be returned .
Even after Kejriwal became the chief minister in December 2013 , he refused to use an official car and preferred his old Wagon R .

" We're not out of this emergency , not even close , " said Mark Ghilarducci , director of the California Governor's Office of Emergency Services .
" But we are seeing some progress in areas the fires have impacted , " Ghilarducci told a news conference .

" It appears he was attempting to evacuate the area on foot when he was overtaken by the fire , " the Mendocino County Sheriff's office told the Ukiah Daily Journal .
Sonoma County officials earlier yesterday reported another death , which had brought the total to 32 .
" We have had some significant progress , " Pimlott said .
" Three smaller fires have been contained , " he said , and " we've increased containment on some of the major fires . "
Pimlott said firefighting efforts could be complicated , however , by winds that were expected to increase overnight to more than 72 kilometers per hour .
Pimlott also said it could be weeks before investigators determine what caused the fires , the deadliest in California's history .
The Griffith Park fire in Los Angeles County in 1933 killed at least 29 people , and 25 people died in the 1991 Oakland Hills fire .
Sonoma County Sheriff Rob Giordano said his department was continuing to track down people reported missing by family or friends .

Maha govt hires advt firms for publicity ; focus to be on social media
Mumbai , Oct 15 ( PTI ) .
The BJP - led Maharashtra government has appointed over a dozen private advertising agencies to publicise its policies and schemes effectively , especially on social media .
A Government Resolution ( GR ) issued on October 12 said that private agencies have been appointed to ensure that welfare schemes , development initiatives and policies of various departments are conveyed properly to the common man .
These agencies have been tasked with formulating and implementing " a result - oriented comprehensive social media promotion strategy " for government campaigns , the GR said .
They will work for the Directorate General of Information and Public Relations ( DGIPR ) .
The agencies will upload videos , infographics , cartoons , animation on social media , post blogs related to government campaigns and send bulk text messages , among other things .
" The government will complete three years soon .
So these agencies have been appointed to reinstate people's trust in the government and improve the image after the implementation of decisions like demonetisation and GST roll - out , " a senior minister said .
" A special emphasis will be on social media , because it has become the main tool for the criticism of government .
Advertising firms have been specifically asked to use hash - tags on social media to create positive trends , " the minister said , speaking on the condition of anonymity .
But engaging private firms for the job of government publicity itself has come in for criticism .
Asked about the move on the sidelines of an event in Mumbai yesterday , NCP chief Sharad Pawar said the government is misusing people's money to counter its detractors .
" Earlier the same work was done by the DGIPR .
By appointing event management companies , the government is misusing people's money to answer those who speak against it , " said Pawar , a former chief minister .
" The government has realised that the social media which helped them win elections has now turned against it , " Pawar added .
State Congress chief Ashok Chavan termed it a " wasteful expenditure " .
" I have heard that the government is spending Rs 300 crore only to publicise itself , fearing people's backlash over ineffective policies .
This is unacceptable as it shows it does not trust its own ( publicity ) machinery , " Chavan told PTI .
" On one hand the government is levying exorbitant surcharge on fuel in the name of farmers , but farmers are under severe stress as the government claims it has no money for granting loan waiver .
How can it spend such a huge amount on publicity ? "
he asked .
AMU , LSR among 4,739 institutions that did not file returns in 2015 - 16 : MHA
New Delhi , Oct 15 ( PTI ) .
IIM Kolkata , Aligarh Muslim University and Delhi's Lady Shri Ram College for Women are among 4,739 institutions and NGOs that have not disclosed to the government their foreign funding and expenditure for 2015 - 16 , according to the Home Ministry said .
According to the ministry documents , accessed by PTI , the 4,739 institutions and voluntary organisations have not filed their annual returns for 2015 - 16 , thus failing to submit details of their annual income and expenditure for the year .
All these institutions and voluntary organisations are registered under the Foreign Contribution ( Regulation ) Act 2010 and it is mandatory for them to file returns every year .
Those which have not filed returns for 2015 - 16 include IIM Kolkaka , IIM Lucknow , Aligarh Muslim University , Delhi's Lady Shri Ram College , Delhi College of Engineering , Nehru Memorial Museum and Library , Delhi , and the Indira Gandhi National Centre For Arts , Delhi .
Others in the list include Vivekananda Foundation , Mysore , Islamic University of Science and Technology , Pulwama in Jammu and Kashmir , Dr Yashwant Singh Parmar University of Horticulture and Forestry , Solan , Himachal Pradesh , and Nehru Indira Rajiv Memorial Association for Needies , Koraput , Odisha .
The Modi government , which has tightened the rules for NGOs , has already cancelled registration of more than 10,000 non - governmental organisations in the last three years for alleged non - filing of annual returns as mandated in the FCRA .
In addition , renewals of more than 1,300 NGOs have been denied for allegedly violating various provisions of the FCRA .
The home ministry has also asked nearly 6,000 NGOs to open their accounts in banks having core banking facilities and furnish details for real - time access to security agencies in case of any discrepancy .
The move was initiated after it was detected that many NGOs have their bank accounts in cooperative banks or state government - owned apex banks or banks which do not have core banking facilities .
In November 2016 , the government had directed more than 11,000 NGOs to file applications for renewal of registration by February 28 , 2017 , and many of them had failed to do so .
Tea Board proposes Rs 100 cr package for Darjeeling gardens
Kolkata , Oct 15 ( PTI ) .
The Tea Board has submitted a Rs 100 - crore package proposal to the Centre for the Darjeeling tea industry , which is readying restart of operations after the prolonged shutdown in the hills .
The Darjeeling Tea Association ( DTA ) , however , had sought a much higher package to compensate for the revenue loss and for payments to workers till the start of next production .
" We have submitted a Rs 100 - crore package proposal to the commerce ministry for helping the crisis - ridden Darjeeling tea industry , which had faced total production loss during the shutdown period , " Tea Board Chairman P K Bezbaruah told PTI .
The money sought is to prune the overgrown tea bushes , he said .
Bezbaruah , however , said it would be not possible for the government to reimburse the losses of the 87 - odd tea gardens of Darjeeling .
" In Dooars and South India , small growers are being hit the hardest due to fall in green leaf prices .
They are being paid only carrying cost ( diesel ) prices of green leaf to the factories , " he said .
The entire Darjeeling premium second and monsoon flushes had been destroyed due to the shutdown , although the tea gardens never announced any closure due to it .
The workers did not report for duty during the period .
Although the strike has been lifted , massive absenteeism among the workers affected cleaning - up operations in the gardens .
" Nearly 60 per cent of the total workers did not report for duty after the bandh was lifted , " a DTA official had recently said .
Govt feels pro bono activity can be criterion for elevation as judge
New Delhi , Oct 15 ( PTI ) .
Free legal assistance extended by a lawyer to the needy should be an important criterion while considering him for elevation as a judge , the government feels .
A senior government functionary said the guidelines laid down recently by the apex court outlining the importance of pro bono has " strengthened " the feeling in the government that " pro bono lawyering " be made a pre - requisite to become a judge .
Like getting the gown of a Senior advocate , pro bono activity can easily be a criterion for becoming a judge for those coming to the bench from active bar service , the functionary said .
Pro bono is something which is done for the public good without any payment or compensation .
On whether the government feels that pro bono service be made a criterion for becoming a judge of the Supreme Court or a high court , Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad merely said , " Our government is keenly promoting pro bono lawyering .
Exposure to pro bono lends its own weight . "
The guidelines fixed by the Supreme Court for itself and the 24 high courts last week to govern the exercise of designating lawyers as Seniors , talk about pro bono activities undertaken by an advocate .
Under the new system , all matters related to designation of Senior advocates would be looked into by a committee which will consider the reputation , conduct , integrity of the advocate , including participation in pro bono work , reported judgement in which the advocate has appeared and the number of such judgements .
But the Supreme Court collegium - - a body of top five judges of the apex court which recommends the names it finds fit for appointment as judges - - will have to take a final call on the issue .
Free legal aid and service in India is primarily the mandate of National Legal Services Authority and State Legal Aid Services authorities which have a wide presence throughout the country .
However , the legal needs of people continue to grow , thus requiring meaningful contribution from the legal community .
But pro bono legal service as a concept has not gained much momentum in the country and remains more of an ad hoc , individualised practice lacking an institutional structure .
" Many lawyers provide the poor and underprivileged clients with valuable legal advice and support without seeking any professional fee .
Unfortunately , this laudable tradition of public service has not received any deserving recognition . . . , " the department of justice in the law ministry has said in a note .
Now , the department of justice intends to create a database of lawyers willing to provide their services to litigants .
It has already written to all bar councils and bar associations across the country to provide information of lawyers who are engaged in providing pro bono legal services to the poor and those who otherwise cannot afford legal representation .

Year after Najeeb went missing from JNU , CBI still clueless
New Delhi , Oct 15 ( PTI ) .
Exactly a year after JNU student Najeeb Ahmed went missing from the campus following a scuffle with some other students , the Central Bureau of Investigation ( CBI ) , which had taken over the probe into the case from the city police , remains clueless .
The high court had first gone after the Delhi Police to solve the mysterious disappearance of Najeeb and since it was not satisfied with the progress made by the city police in the case , it transferred it to the central probe agency on May 16 this year .
Najeeb ( 27 ) , a student of M.Sc Biotechnology , went missing from the Mahi - Mandvi hostel of the Jawaharlal Nehru University ( JNU ) on October 15 , 2016 .
His family members are still running from pillar to post to trace him .
Najeeb had an altercation with several students , allegedly affiliated to the BJP's student wing , the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad ( ABVP ) , according to his friends and family .
After over a month had passed since Najeeb went missing , his mother , Fatima Nafees , moved the Delhi High Court , seeking directions to the police to trace her son .
The high court had immediately directed the Delhi Police to " explore all angles " and " cut across political barriers " to trace the young man , saying no one could just vanish from the heart of the national capital .
However , as the police were clueless about Najeeb's whereabouts even after two months since he went missing , it had to face the ire of the court , which asked it to scan the entire JNU campus , including hostels , classrooms and rooftops , with the help of sniffer dogs .
However , the police failed to sniff out any lead even after pressing 600 personnel and several sniffer dogs into service .
This prompted the high court to suggest other methods such as lie detector tests of the nine students suspected to be behind Najeeb's disappearance as they had allegedly beaten him up before he went missing .
Though the police sent notices to the nine students , asking them to appear for a polygraph ( lie detector ) test , they ignored the same and subsequently , moved the trial court , challenging the step taken by the investigating agency .
Even as the nine students were opposing the lie detector test , Najeeb's family alleged in the court that they were being harassed by the Delhi Police , which was conducting pre - dawn searches at their house in Badaun , Uttar Pradesh .
Dissatisfied with the lack of progress in the investigation , the family later demanded that the probe be handed over to some other agency .
In March this year , even the high court admitted that it was " foxed " by the lack of information on the missing student's whereabouts and demanded an answer from the police " one way or the other " on Najeeb's fate , saying that as far as the probe was concerned , the only thing happening was paperwork .
While the high court was monitoring the investigation , a magisterial court , on March 30 , rejected the nine suspected students ' plea against the police notice asking them to appear for a polygraph test .
A few days later , the decision of the magisterial court was stayed by a sessions court , which subsequently quashed it .
Continuing with its probe , the police filed a chargesheet against a man , who was arrested for allegedly making a ransom call to Najeeb's relatives , demanding Rs 20 lakh for his release .
However , his family kept urging the high court to transfer the probe to some other agency and finally on May 16 , it was handed over to the CBI .
Two months later , on July 17 , the probe agency sought more time from the court to investigate the case .
Nearly a month later , when the CBI failed to file a fresh progress report in the case , the high court rebuked it , saying the probe was not transferred to the agency " for fun " .
On September 6 , the court again directed the CBI to take steps to trace Najeeb .
On the same day , the agency filed a status report on the investigation in a sealed envelope .
The CBI counsel informed the court that the agency had examined 26 people , including JNU officials , staff , Najeeb's friends , colleagues and those who had issues with him , during its investigation .
The agency also told the court that the matter was widely publicised in 12 cities and that several mortuaries were also being monitored .
Apart from that , last one year's railway records of passengers of the same name and age as that of the missing student had been called for , it told the high court , which is slated to hear the matter tomorrow ( October 16 ) .

J - K Police to acquire intrusion detection system
Srinagar , Oct 15 ( PTI ) .
The Jammu and Kashmir Police is in the process of acquiring new gadgets including intrusion detection system and electric boom barriers to prevent militants from carrying out suicide attacks on its installations .
The equipment worth Rs eight crore will be procured by the police , which is at the forefront of fighting militancy in the state , within the next two to three months , sources in the police department said .
They said on the wish list of the policemen is an intrusion detection system for important police installations in the state , especially the valley , to prevent any suicide attacks on these estbalishments .
" The intrusion detection system has shock sensors which use vibrations or shock waves to trigger an alarm at the monitoring desk .
This will give enough time to the security personnel to not only prepare but also counter any intrusion bid by terrorists , " the sources said .
For improving day time security and ensuring smooth entry and exit of authorised security personnel to police establishments , the department will install radio frequency identification ( RFID ) based vehicle access control system at these places .
" The vehicles of authorised personnel , like senior officers of the department , will be fitted with RFID tags that will allow them entry and exit without any manual intervention .
This will save a lot of time at the entry and exit points of important police establishments .
" This will ensure that vehicles not fitted with RFID tags will be thoroughly checked before being allowed to enter , " they added .
Hand - held ground penetrating radar ( GPR ) system is another important gadget on the shopping list of police .
" The GPR system is used for effective detection of improvised explosive devices , landmines and other explosives which are buried underground .
" Besides reducing the risk of casualties during sanitisation operations , the GPR system will also help in tracking down the ammunition and explosives hidden by militants under ground , " the sources said .
On the law and order front , policemen , who have to deal with street protests in the valley on regular basis , will soon be getting anti - riot gas masks , they said .
" The law enforcing personnel have to fire tear smoke shells and other gas - based crowd control weapons during street protests .
" Many a time it becomes an impediment in restoration of order for the policemen as they face lot of difficulty in crossing the gas - affected areas while chasing away miscreants .
The gas masks will remove this impediment , " the sources said .
It's like winning Test match by an innings : Sidhu on Gurdaspur win
Gurdaspur ( Pb ) , Oct 15 ( PTI ) .
Punjab cabinet minister and former cricketer Navjot Singh Sidhu today likened the Congress ' victory in the Gurdaspur Lok Sabha bypoll to winning a Test cricket match by an innings and said it would have a demoralising effect on the BJP - SAD combine .
Congress candidate Sunil Jakhar won the Gurdaspur Lok Sabha bypoll by defeating his nearest rival , BJP nominee Swaran Salaria with a margin of 1,93,219 votes .
Jakhar polled 4,99,752 votes while Salaria polled 3,06,533 , an election official said .
Sidhu said , " This win is a big slap on the face of jija - sala ( Sukhbir Badal - Bikram Majithia ) .
Today , the BJP will feel that the Akali Dal in Punjab , especially the jija - sala , have become a burden . "
" Time and again people have reprimanded them and sent them back , " he said , adding the Akalis were like an albatross around the BJP's neck .
Sidhu , who switched over to Congress from the BJP just before the Punjab Assembly polls , said , " We have sent a beautiful Diwali gift packed with red ribbon to our ( Congress ) would - be president Rahul Gandhi because it sets the tone . . .
It will be a shot in the arm for the Congress . "
" This win is not small , this is huge .
When a ( cricket ) team loses by five runs or by a narrow margin , it still stands up to put a fight in another contest .
But when somebody loses by 400 runs or suffers an innings defeat , it breaks the back .
" It is an innings defeat for them ( SAD - BJP combine ) .
It is a demoralising defeat for them , it has sent them packing , " he said .
On the fact that the Congress ' win in Gurdaspur bypoll would not make much difference to the NDA tally in the Lok Sabha numerically , Sidhu said , " The mental scars will remain because it is a mental game . "
" This is because Gurdaspur was considered an Akali - BJP bastion .
Of the four times we fought the elections , Vinod ji ( late Vinod Khanna of the BJP ) won three times .
And when we ( Congress ) won once , it was by a very thin margin .
So , this ( today's result ) is a signal sent across , loud and clear , " the Punjab minister said .
" When Sonia ( Gandhi ) ji had power , she passed it on to Manmohan Singh ( who became the prime minister ) . . . when she did not have power ( when the party is out of power ) and when the time came to fight , she put her son Rahul Gandhi ahead .
" This is what is special about a true leader .
When the times are hard , the leader stands like a rock to face it and when times are good , gives credit to workers , " Sidhu said .
He gave credit of Congress ' victory in the bypoll to Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh the party's senior leadership and the workers .
Alleging that the SAD - BJP combine had done nothing for the development of Gurdaspur region Sidhu said , " We ( Congress ) need at least one or two years to bring in development . "
Bengaluru rains : Girl drowns in drain , toll mounts to 10
Bengaluru , Oct 15 ( PTI ) .
A 16 - year - old girl drowned in an overflowing drain today , taking the death toll from rain - related incidents in the city to 10 .
The incident happened at Krishnappa Garden here .
Narasamma had gone to attend nature's call and she accidentally slipped into the drain .
Her body was later recovered at some distance from the slum where her family resides .
The family hailed from a northern district of Karnataka and they worked as construction labourers in the city .
Meanwhile , the city civic body Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike along with the National Disaster Response Force and the State Disaster Response Force fished out the body of 22 - year - old Pushpa from a storm - water drain at Kumbalgodu this morning .
Pushpa and her mother Ningamma were washed away in the storm water drain following heavy rains in the city on Friday night .
Officials involved in search operations said efforts were on to recover Ningamma's body .
The 10 deaths in the past 15 days in mishaps due to potholes and incessant rains have triggered a political slugfest between ruling the Congress and the BJP .
Speaking to reporters in Mysuru , Chief Minister Siddaramaiah hit out at the BJP for politicising the issue .
He said his government has taken up the repair work and clearance of the 850 - km storm water drain network in the city by allocating Rs 800 crore .
" No government including the BJP has done it in the past .
Now they are playing politics over deaths , " he said .
Siddaramaiah said he had been residing in Bengaluru since 1983 and he had never seen such large scale rains .
About 46 days in the last two months gauged heavy rains , he said , adding " our drainage system and storm water drains do not have the capacity to bear it " .
BJP state president Yeddyurappa who visited the rain affected areas yesterday had squarely blamed Siddaramaiah for the deaths .
Reports quoting MeT department officials suggested the city has witnessed about 1,620 mm of rainfall this year so far , breaking the record of about 1,600 mm of precipitation in 2005 .
The department has predicted generally cloudy sky in and around Bengaluru , one or two spells of rain and heavy showers in some areas in the next 48 hours .

Rohingya man held for illegally procuring Aadhaar card
Hyderabad , Oct 15 ( PTI ) .
The police today arrested a 19 - year - old Rohingya man here on charges of illegally procuring an Aadhaar card and illegally staying in the country .
The Indian employer of the man , who had claimed to be his father in order to get him the Aadhaar card , was also placed under arrest , a police official said .
The Rohingya man , Mohammad Ajamuddin alias Molla Ajamuddin , and his employer Riyazuddin Molla ( 36 ) , a native of West Bengal , were nabbed from the Burma huts in the Balapur area here , he added .
Both the men were in the garment business and had recently come to the city from Kolkata , the police said .

About a year ago , Molla went to Bangladesh for some work related to his garment business and got acquainted to Ajamuddin , " the official attached to the Rachakonda Police Commissionerate said .
" Molla informed Ajamuddin that he could earn more money in India and gave his phone number to him .
Subsequently , Ajamuddin came to Kolkata and met him .
Since then , he has been working for Molla for a monthly salary of Rs 6,000 .
Molla was providing shelter to him illegally , " he added .
Molla also allegedly helped Ajamuddin get an Aadhaar card by giving false information to the UIDAI authorities , stating that the latter was his son , and violated the provisions of the Foreigners Act , the official said .
He had recently brought Ajamuddin to Hyderabad , he added .
Acting on a tip - off , the police nabbed the duo and seized their Aadhaar cards .
A case was registered against the two under IPC sections 420 ( cheating ) , 468 ( forgery for purpose of cheating ) , 471 ( using as genuine a forged document ) and relevant sections of the Foreigners Act , the official said .
Last month , the Rachakonda police had arrested a 20 - year - old Rohingya man , who allegedly claimed to be an Indian citizen and applied for a passport to enable him to go to Dubai .
The police had also seized a PAN card from him .
Scores of Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar's Rakhine state have been fleeing the restive region since August amid a fresh wave of violence , triggering a refugee crisis in neighbouring Bangladesh and India .
Union minister Kiren Rijiju had recently said the Rohingya Muslims were illegal immigrants and pitched for their deportation .

KVIC launches six and eight - spindle Charkha for coarse Khadi
New Delhi , Oct 15 ( PTI ) .
Khadi and Village Industries Commission ( KVIC ) has launched an improved six and eight - spindle Charkha ( spinning wheel ) for coarse Khadi weaving .
The new Charkhas were unveiled by Union minister of Micro , Small and Medium Enterprises Giriraj Singh at Ahmedabad recently in presence of KVIC Chairman V K Saxena .
The coarse count six - spindle Charkha has been developed by Khadi Prayog Samiti ( Ahmedabad ) , a KVIC unit established in 1958 for technical intervention in Khadi activities .
KVIC had given Rs 15 lakh to the Prayog Samiti in June for research and development in Charkha technology .
The new Charkha would produce more coarse count Khadi ( popularly known as Moti Khadi ) ) with less drudgery .
" At present , the coarse count Khadi thread is produced from traditional single - spindle Charkha , which can produce only four to five hanks per day , resulting into very meager income to the artisans .
" This new six and eight - spindle Charkha will produce at least 20 to 25 hanks per day , subsequently increasing the artisans ' income substantially , i.e . , Rs 200 and more per day , " a release said .
It further said that it would also reduce the drudgeries significantly .
" After Independence ?
for the first time , a new Charkha has been developed for the coarse count Khadi ?
used to make towel , darees , napkin , carpets and other items , " the press statement stated .
Hailing KVIC's efforts , Giriraj Singh said that the new Charkha has fulfilled the dreams of Mahatma Gandhi .
" It will certainly benefit the artisans and open new avenues in the development of Charkha , " he added .
Echoing similar views , KVIC Chairman Saxena said that it " is historic day for Khadi as these new Charkhas are the result of motivation and comprehensive vision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi ji . "
" I hope that it will go a long way as it will bring happiness to more than two lakh artisans associated with Moti Khadi , " he said .
Recently , KVIC also distributed 500 bee - boxes among 100 adivasi families in the Kumhera village of Arawali district in Gujarat .
The boxes were distributed by KVIC Chairman .
These boxes were given to the tribal women , who have successfully completed their five - day - training in this connection .
The bee - keeping in the sleepy hamlet of Kumhera , which has an abundant flora and fauna , would create a positive impact through pollination on the yield of crops like cotton and maze ?
grown by the adivasis there .
After distributing the bee - boxes , Saxena said that it was the mission of Prime Minister not only to double the income of farmers through bee - keeping , but to make them healthy also with the consumption of honey .
The Chairman also distributed 200 bottles of honey at the function among the 200 adivasi families present there .
Along with bee boxes , tools such as protection caps , hand - gloves and nets were also given free to the adivasi farmers .

276 killed in deadliest single attack in Somalia's history
Mogadishu , Oct 16 ( AP ) The most powerful bomb blast ever witnessed in Somalia's capital killed 276 people with around 300 others injured , the country's information minister said early today , making it the deadliest single attack in this Horn of Africa nation .
The toll could continue to rise .
In a tweet , Abdirahman Osman called the attack " barbaric " and said countries including Turkey and Kenya had already offered to send medical aid .
Hospitals were overwhelmed a day after a truck bomb targeted a crowded street near key government ministries , including foreign affairs .
As angry protesters gathered near the scene of the attack , Somalia's government blamed the al - Qaida - linked al - Shabab extremist group for what it called a " national disaster . "
However , Africa's deadliest Islamic extremist group , which often targets high - profile areas of the capital , had yet to comment .
Al - Shabab earlier this year vowed to step up attacks after both the Trump administration and Somalia's recently elected president announced new military efforts against the group .
The Mogadishu bombing is one of the deadliest attacks in sub - Saharan Africa , larger than the Garissa University attack in Kenya in 2015 and the US Embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998 .
Doctors at Mogadishu hospitals struggled to assist badly wounded victims , many burned beyond recognition .
" This is really horrendous , unlike any other time in the past , " said Dr Mohamed Yusuf , the director of Medina hospital .
Inside , bleary - eyed nurses transported a man whose legs had been blown off .
He waited as surgeons attended to another badly injured patient .
Exhausted doctors struggled to keep their eyes open , while screams from victims and newly bereaved families echoed through the halls .
" Nearly all of the wounded victims have serious wounds , " said nurse Samir Abdi .
" Unspeakable horrors . "
The smell of blood was strong .
A teary - eyed Hawo Yusuf looked at her husband's badly burned body .
" He may die waiting , " she said .
" We need help . "
Ambulance sirens echoed across the city as bewildered families wandered in the rubble of buildings , looking for missing relatives .
" In our 10 year experience as the first responder in # Mogadishu , we haven't seen anything like this , " the Aamin Ambulance service tweeted .
Grief overwhelmed many .
" There's nothing I can say .
We have lost everything , " wept Zainab Sharif , a mother of four who lost her husband .
She sat outside a hospital where he was pronounced dead after hours of efforts by doctors to save him .
The country's Somali - American leader , President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed , declared three days of mourning and joined thousands of people who responded to a desperate plea by hospitals to donate blood .
" I am appealing all Somali people to come forward and donate , " he said .
Mogadishu , a city long accustomed to deadly bombings by al - Shabab , was stunned by the force of Saturday's blast .
The explosion shattered hopes of recovery in an impoverished country left fragile by decades of conflict , and it again raised doubts over the government's ability to secure the seaside city of more than 2 million people .
" They don't care about the lives of Somali people , mothers , fathers and children , " Prime Minister Hassan Ali Khaire said of the attackers .
" They have targeted the most populated area in Mogadishu , killing only civilians . "
Rescue workers searched for survivors trapped under the rubble of the largely destroyed Safari Hotel , which is close to Somalia's foreign ministry .
The explosion blew off metal gates and blast walls erected outside the hotel .
The United States condemned the bombing , saying " such cowardly attacks reinvigorate the commitment of the United States to assist our Somali and African Union partners to combat the scourge of terrorism . "
It tweeted a photo of its charge d'affaires in Somalia donating blood .
But the US Africa Command said US forces had not been asked to provide aid .
A spokesman told The Associated Press that first responders and local enforcement would handle the response and " the US would offer assistance if and when a request was made . "
The US military has stepped up drone strikes and other efforts this year against al - Shabab , which is also fighting the Somali military and over 20,000 African Union forces in the country .
The United Nations special envoy to Somalia called the attack " revolting , " saying an unprecedented number of civilians had been killed .
Michael Keating said the UN and African Union were supporting the Somali government's response with " logistical support , medical supplies and expertise . "
The spokesman for UN Secretary - General Antonio Guterres strongly condemned the attack and urged all Somalis to unite against extremism and work together to build a " functional " federal state .
Saturday's blast occurred two days after the head of the US Africa Command was in Mogadishu to meet with Somalia's president , and two days after the country's defense minister and army chief resigned for undisclosed reasons .
Amid the chaos , the stories of victims began to emerge .
Amino Ahmed said one of her friends , a female medical student , was killed on the eve of her graduation .
The explosion also killed a couple returning from a hospital after having their first child , said Dahir Amin Jesow , a Somali lawmaker .
" It's a dark day for us , " he said .

Eight dead as Rohingya boat sinks off Bangladesh
Cox's Bazar ( Bangladesh ) , Oct 16 ( AFP ) .
At least eight people drowned and dozens more are missing after a boat packed with Rohingya fleeing to Bangladesh sank today , the latest victims of a half a million strong exodus sparked by an army crackdown in Myanmar .
The boat was carrying an estimated 50 people when it went down in the estuary of the Naf river that divides the two countries , Border Guard Bangladesh ( BGB ) area commander Lieutenant Colonel S M Ariful Islam told AFP .
Nearly 200 Rohingya have drowned over the last six weeks making the perilous crossing into Bangladesh , many in small wooden fishing boats that are dangerously overloaded .
They are fleeing violence in Myanmar's sectarian - plagued Rakhine state where the United Nations has accused troops of waging an ethnic cleansing campaign against the Rohingya Muslim minority .
Islam said the bodies of the eight confirmed victims had washed up on the river banks , while 21 survivors had swum to safety .
" Eight people were killed .
The majority were children , " he said , adding the small fishing trawler was overloaded with refugees desperate to escape .
Coast and border guards were conducting a search and rescue operation in the Naf river , he said .
More than half a million Rohingya have arrived in Bangladesh over the last seven weeks to escape a military crackdown that the the UN has said amounts to ethnic cleansing .
The stateless Muslim minority has faced decades of persecution in mainly Buddhist Myanmar .
The latest influx began in late August after attacks by Rohingya militants on police posts in Myanmar .
Another border guard told AFP the boat sank was just 200 yards ( metres ) from the Bangladesh coast when it sank in rough waters .
Fazlul Haq , a local official , said the boat was owned by a Bangladeshi villager who had made large amounts of money ferrying Rohingya into the country .
He said the small fishing trawlers were highly vulnerable to accidents as they approached the shore , where they are often battered by large waves .
Refugees are often charged exorbitant fees for the trip .
The latest accident came a week after another boat packed with Rohingya refugees capsized in the area , killing at least 34 people .

Iraqi forces say in control of roads , infrastructure near Kirkuk
Baghdad , Oct 16 ( AFP ) .
Iraqi forces said today they had taken control of roads and infrastructure from Kurdish fighters near the disputed city of Kirkuk as tensions soar following a controversial independence referendum .
Iraq's Joint Operations Command , which groups all pro - government forces , said it was making progress in its operation to " restore security " in Kirkuk .
Iraqi forces are aiming to retake military bases and oil fields which Kurdish peshmerga fighters took during the fightback against the Islamic State jihadist group ( IS ) .
Central government forces took control of two bridges , two roads and an industrial zone to the southwest of Kirkuk as well as gas facilities , a power station , a refinery and a police station , the JOC said .
Iraqi and Kurdish forces exchanged artillery fire early Monday south of the city , after government forces began a " major operation " in the oil - rich province .
The offensive follows a standoff between Kurdish forces and the Iraqi army prompted by the September 25 non - binding referendum that produced a resounding " yes " for independence for the autonomous Kurdish region of northern Iraq .
Baghdad has declared the referendum - - held despite international opposition - - illegal .
Both sides are key US allies in the battle against the jihadists , and the crisis has raised fears of fresh chaos just as Iraqi forces are on the verge of routing IS from the last territory it controls in the country .

Iraq face acid test against Mali in U - 17 WC pre - quarters
Margao , Oct 16 ( PTI ) .
Last edition's runner - up Mali will enjoy an upperhand over a gutsy Iraq in a tricky pre - quarterfinal match of the FIFA U - 17 World Cup , here tomorrow .
Two - time champions Mali have had a good performance so far though they finished runners - up in Group B .
They lost to eventual group toppers Paraguay in a narrow 2 - 3 result but came back strongly to win convincingly against Turkey ( 3 - 0 ) and New Zealand ( 3 - 1 ) to finish with six points .
The African side's speedy run down the flanks and stronger physique will pose a lot of threat for the Iraqi defence and it will be interesting to see how the Lions of Mesopotamia , who will be playing without their star player and captain Mohammed Dawood tomorrow , counter the Mali attackers .
For Mali strikers Lassana Ndiaye and Djemoussa Traore have combined well upfront and have posed threats to their opponents ' defence with their speedy runs but have been found wanting in front of the goal as they have wasted a lot of scoring chances .
Attacking midfielder Salim Jidhou will keep the Mali offensive moves going along with Hadji Drame who look dangerous on either flank .
The biggest concern for Mali is their defence which was exposed by Paraguay and it is to be seen how the Iraqis take advantage in the absence of their star striker Mohammed Dawood .
Iraq finished runners - up in Group F behind England .
They drew their first match against Mexico 1 - 1 , then came up with a top class performance to beat Chile 3 - 0 before losing to England 0 - 4 to finish on four points .
It was a disappointing match for the Asian champions against England as they were not only drubbed 0 - 4 but also lost captain Mohammed Dawood for tomorrow's match after he received a yellow card in the 62nd minute , his second in the tournament .
Dawood has been the inspiration in the attack and was the leading scorer for his side with three goals and his absence will surely be felt tomorrow .
Iraq have returned to the place where they played last year to win the Asian U - 16 Championships .
They have been good only on patches and their coach Qahtan Chathir would be hoping that his boys give their best tomorrow .
They have a reason to give an inspiring performance tomorrow as this has been their first ever knock - out stage qualification in this tournament .
Iraq have featured in the FIFA U - 17 World Cup only once earlier , at UAE 2013 .
That experience was not particularly memorable as they finished last in their group losing all their three matches .
Teams ( from ) : Mali : Alkalifa Coulibaly , Boubacar Haidara , Djemoussa Traore , Fode Konate , Mamadi Fofana , Mohamed Camara , Hadji Drame , Abdoulaye Dabo , Seme Camara , Salam Giddou , Mamadou Traore , Mahamane Toure , Soumaila Doumbia , Siaka Sidibe , Abdoulaye Diaby , Youssouf Koita , Mamadou Samake , Ibrahiim Kane , Lassana Ndiayne , Cheick Oumar Doucoure , Massire Gassama .

BJP getting intolerant to criticism on social media : Sena
Mumbai , Oct 16 ( PTI ) .
The Shiv Sena today accused its ally BJP of getting " intolerant " towards criticism on social media , saying it was this platform that greatly helped the saffron party win elections .
The government should introspect and correct itself where it has erred , rather than showing intolerance towards criticism , the Sena said .
An editorial in Sena mouthpiece ' Saamana ' said , " The BJP government's stand is that the prime minister , the president and the chief ministers should not be insulted and that people should be patient . "
" However , where did this call for patience and good manners disappear when Manmohan Singh was time and again made fun of when he was the prime minister ? "
it asked .
The editorial said the BJP's situation is such that " it is getting bogged down in a pit it dug for somebody else " .
" The social media , which it used for running down the opposition has now begun to unmask the BJP , " the Sena said .
" The government gets intolerant when it is ridiculed by the youth when its promises turned out to be false after coming to power .
The prime minister should declare if there is no freedom to air one's views about the government or the BJP , " it said .

New Delhi , Oct 16 ( PTI ) .
Rhetoric will rain down on Gujarat , Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi said in a " weather report " ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to his home state today .

Assembly elections in Himachal Pradesh will be held on November 9 and results announced on December 18 .

Dengue sting : Two more deaths in Delhi , 5220 cases
New Delhi , Oct 16 ( PTI ) .
Two more persons , including a 26 - year - old Manipuri woman , have succumbed to dengue in the national capital , even as the number of people affected by the vector - borne disease this season has mounted to 5,220 , according to a municipal report released today .
With the two deaths reported , the toll from dengue in Delhi has risen to three .
The mosquito - borne tropical disease had claimed its first victim in the city this year , when a 12 - year - old boy died of dengue shock syndrome at the Sir Ganga Ram Hospital ( SGRH ) on August 1 .
Rhoda Daimai , who was living in south Delhi's Sarita Vihar died on August 27 of septicaemia and other ensuing complications while 49 - year - old Meena Devi , hailing from Bihar , died of dengue shock syndrome on September 2 , the report said .
Civic bodies said Daimai was a resident of a village in Manipur and had come to Delhi seeking treatment while Meena lived in Karawal Nagar in east Delhi .
While Meena also died at the SGRH , Rhoda succumbed at the Holy Family Hospital .
The number of malaria and chikungunya cases recorded in the city till October 14 at 1062 and 683 respectively , the report by the South Delhi Municipal Corporation ( SDMC ) , which tabulates data for the entire city , said .
Of the total 5,220 dengue cases , 2564 were residents of Delhi , while the rest were from other states .
Of the 2,564 Delhi cases , 757 were reported this month , it said .
Cases of vector - borne diseases are usually reported between mid - July and November - end .
This year , however , it has been much earlier .
Doctors attribute this to an early monsoon .
Dengue and chikungunya are caused by the aedes aegypti mosquito , which breeds in clear water .
The female anopheles mosquito , which causes malaria , can breed in both fresh and muddy water .
According to the SDMC , mosquito breeding has been reported from 4,78,978 households in Delhi .
All the three municipal corporations in the city have stepped up awareness drives , distributing pamphlets and plying vehicles with loudspeakers announcing dos and don'ts for prevention .
The Aam Aadmi Party ( AAP ) government in the city has banned over - the - counter sale of nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs such as Aspirin and Brufen as their use may " pose a threat " to dengue and chikungunya patients .
At least 21 deaths due to dengue were reported last year from various city hospitals , including nine at AIIMS , though the official figure of the civic bodies stood at 10 .
Seventeen deaths , suspected to be due to malaria , were also reported by civic bodies last year .
At least 15 fatalities were reported last year from various city hospitals due to complications triggered by chikungunya , though civic authorities kept the death tally at zero .
One of the worst outbreaks of chikungunya was in 2016 when 12,221 were reported till December 24 , 2016 .
Of these , 9,749 were confirmed .

Will govt now tell tourists not to visit Taj Mahal : Owaisi on Som's remarks
Hyderabad , Oct 16 ( PTI ) .
Responding to BJP's Uttar Pradesh legislator Sangeet Som's comments questioning Taj Mahal's place in history , AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi today asked if the government would tell tourists not to visit the monument .
Courting fresh controversy , Som yesterday questioned Taj Mahal's place in history , distorting historical facts to say that it was built by an emperor who had imprisoned his father and targeted Hindus .
In comments that came after the Yogi Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh reportedly left out the Taj Mahal from an official tourism booklet , Som said , " Many people were pained to see that the Taj Mahal was removed from the list of places ( tourist destinations ) .
What type of history ?
" Is this history that the person who built the Taj Mahal imprisoned his father ?
Do you call it history when the one who built the Taj targeted many Hindus in Uttar Pradesh and Hindustan ? "
In fact , Mughal emperor Shah Jahan , who built the Taj Mahal in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal , was the one imprisoned till the end of his days by his son Aurangzeb .
The MLA from Sardhana also termed Mughal emperors Babur , Akbar and Aurangzeb " traitors " and said their names would be removed from the pages of history .
Responding to the comments , Owaisi , the Lok Sabha member from Hyderabad , tweeted , " " Traitors " also build Red Fort will Modi stop hoisting Tiranga ?
Can Modi and Yogi tell domestic and foreign tourist not to visit Taj Mahal ? "
The All India Majlis - e - Ittehadul Muslimeen ( AIMIM ) chief also said Hyderabad House in Delhi , the venue for the Centre hosting foreign dignitaries , was built by " traitor " .
" Even Hyderabad House in Delhi was built by " Traitor " will Modi stop hosting Foreign Dignitaries ? "
he asked .
Hyderabad House was built by Osman Ali Khan , the last Nizam , on a land offered by the British .
Addressing a gathering yesterday at Sisoli village in Uttar Pradesh after inaugurating a statue of 8th century king Anangpal Singh Tomar , Som had also said invaders of India have been glorified in history .

The Karnataka BJP has filed a complaint with the state Anti - Corruption Bureau ( ACB ) against Chief Minister Siddaramaiah , accusing him of " illegally denotifying " land resulting in a loss of Rs 300 crore to the Bengaluru Development Authority .
The complaint yesterday , came days after the party's OBC Morcha chief B J Puttaswamy accused Siddaramaiah of illegally denotifying land .
In his complaint , N R Ramesh , a former member of Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike , the city civic body , has named Siddaramaiah and senior government officials , and accused them of causing Rs 300 crore loss to Bengaluru Development Authority .
Puttaswamy had on October 10 alleged that Siddaramaiah was directly responsible for the denotification of land to the extent of over six acres in survey Nos .
20 and 21 at Bhoopasandra , Bangalore North Taluk , and this had resulted in the loss of Rs 300 crore .

Infra sector investment , bankruptcy reforms top priorities for govt : Economic Secretary
Washington , Oct 17 ( PTI ) .
Getting investment in the infrastructure sector and bankruptcy reforms are the two issues which are on the top of the government's agenda , Economic Affairs Secretary Subhash Chandra Garg has said .
Noting that India has no such framework for dissolving bankrupt and insolvent units , he said that the reform in this sector would bring in an state - of - the - art kind of system which works on strict and stringent timelines .
" My focus will be on what can make a bigger contribution to India's economic growth and macroeconomic management , " Garg told PTI in an interview .
Garg was here as part of a delegation led by Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley , to attend the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank .
He said that going forward , India will have to do a lot more in the infrastructure sector , as investment in this sector can meet India's growing aspiration for a better economy , for a better life and better management .
" So , to my mind one of the biggest policy priorities is to increase investments , get investment in infrastructure .
That story is very very important , " he said , while detailing about his priorities .
Unfolding of the bankruptcy reforms is another area top on his agenda .
" The other thing which you look very keenly to see how it unfolds is the new regime of bankruptcy reforms , " he said .
Resolving insolvency and broken funds would help the banking sector to improve its performance , Garg said .
" Whatever hit it takes , it takes , but the going entity becomes a better economic contributor than otherwise , " he said , adding that going forward , these would be the two big areas " we will look for " .
He also said that the massive need in India is to make it a formal economy , a less cash economy , improving based on transactions that those are the areas where ( we will work ) .
To a question on differences in perception by analysts back home about the Indian economy and by top officials of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank , Garg said the commentators in India seems to be " far more influenced by short term outcomes " , whereas people at the IMF and the World Bank take more of a long - term view , try to evaluate the real implications of such bold big reform initiatives .
" They also make a sort of relative view about how others are doing , whereas in India commentators seems to be more focused about India - specific implications .

Amaravati , Oct 17 ? ( PTI ) .
YSR Congress MP Butta Renuka finally crossed over to Andhra Pradesh's ruling Telugu Desam Party today , more than three years she made her first attempt to join the party .

Renuka is the second YSRC MP to switch sides to the TDP after S P Y Reddy of Nandyal , also in Kurnool district .
The YSRC had petitioned the Lok Sabha speaker against Reddy and sought his disqualification under the Anti - Defection Law but the plea has been pending for over three years .
The YSRC alleged that the ruling party lured the Kurnool MP with offers of money .
The party had eight MPs in the Lok Sabha from Andhra Pradesh after the 2014 elections but the number has now fallen to six .
Renuka , a businesswoman and relatively new to politics , tried to join the TDP soon after her election in May 2014 , following in the footsteps of her colleague Reddy .

She , however , continued to maintain a close relationship with TDP leaders over the years .
" I am happy to associate with the TDP for development of the state .
The chief minister has been striving to develop the state after all the turmoil caused by the bifurcation , " Renuka told reporters in the presence of Naidu .
The chief minister appreciated her for joining hands with him in the development process .

The pre - poll electoral tie - up was for 2017 UP Assembly elections . "

It is the issues and prevailing situation which decides whether we opt for an electoral tie - up or not , " he said .
The SP leader said the party's coordination with the Congress is good and in some ways their ideologies also match .

Shia board to gift silver arrows for Ayodhya Lord Ram statue
Lucknow , Oct 17 ( PTI ) .
Noting that the construction of a statue of Lord Ram in Ayodhya was a matter of pride for all Indians , the Uttar Pradesh Shia Central Waqf Board has said it would gift 10 silver arrows for his quiver as a mark of respect .
" UP government's decision to erect a statue of Lord Ram is commendable .
In keeping with the Ganga - Jamuni ' tehzeeb ' of Awadh , these silver arrows will be just a token of admiration and esteem in which Shias hold Lord Ram , " board's chairman Waseem Rizvi said .
In a letter to Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath , he said the construction of the statue would put UP on the world map .
" The Nawabs of this region always respected the temples in Ayodhya .
Even the land for Hanuman Garhi in central Ayodhya was donated by Nawab Shuja - ud - Daulah in 1739 , while the funds to construct the Hanuman Garhi temple were provided by Nawab Asif - ud - Daullah , between 1775 and 1793 , " Rizvi pointed out .
Earlier , he welcomed the Adityanath government's move to build a 100 - metre - high statue of Lord Ram on the banks of Saryu river in Ayodhya , claiming the land actually belonged to Shias and not the Sunni Waqf Board .
The Shia Board is one of the parties in the appeals pending in the Supreme Court .

Sena rails against govt over Tejas Express food poisoning
Mumbai , Oct 17 ( PTI ) .
There was more focus on showing off than providing basic facilities and security to train passengers , the Shiv Sena said today .
The party's comments come two days after 26 people on the Mumbai - bound Tejas Express from Goa fell due to suspected food poisoning after eating breakfast on the premium train .
The BJP ally said the railways , which has seen a slew of mishaps in the last few weeks , was playing with the lives of people .
" There is more focus on showing off than providing basic facilities and security to passengers .
Travelling by rail amounts to putting one's life at risk .
" Every year , 20,000 - 25,000 lives are lost due to rail - related incidents .
Questions like old infrastructure , old foot overbridges , old signalling system have been pending ( resolution ) for years , " the Sena said in an editorial in party mouthpiece ` Saamana ' .
Passengers have been regularly complaining about unhygienic food served on trains .
The situation now is such that they don't even bother to complain , the Marathi daily said .
" Some passengers of Tejas Express had to undergo a ` poisonous exam ' ( a reference to food poisoning on - board the train ) .
As always , the official concerned was suspended and an inquiry was ordered .
But how was low quality food served when the train boasts of serving food at par with airlines ? "
it asked .
Last year , the CAG had raised questions about the standard of food being served in trains .
A lizard was recently found in food served in Kolkata - Delhi Purva Express .
Also , some passengers fell ill after eating food in Rajdhani Express , the Sena publication said .
" Peoples ' lives are being played with .
The previous railways minister had given an assurance about improving the catering service and providing good quality food but the Tejas incident has proved that all the assurances were false , " it said .
If the railways boasts of providing food to 11 lakh passengers daily , it should also take the responsibility of ensuring that food doesn't cause poisoning , the Sena said .

Iraq forces take two key Kirkuk oil field from Kurds
Baghdad , Oct 17 ( AFP ) .
Iraqi forces took control of the two largest oil fields in the disputed northern province of Kirkuk today dealing a heavy blow to the finances of the autonomous Kurdish government .
The Kurds withdrew without a fight after federal government troops and militia seized the provincial governor's office and key military bases and oil fields as tensions boiled over following a Kurdish vote for independence last month .
" Federal police units took control of the Bai Hassan and Havana oil fields , " north of the city of Kirkuk , a statement said .
Kurdish technicians had halted operations at the two fields and left the wells on Monday , an oil ministry official in Baghdad said .
The fields accounted for around 250,000 barrels per day of the 650,000 bpd that the autonomous Kurdish region exported under its own auspices , outside the purview of Baghdad , and their loss is a major blow to its revenues .
The regional government took over the two fields in 2014 when federal troops withdrew in the face of the jihadists ' lightning advance through areas north and west of Baghdad .
The autonomous Kurdish region is already going through its worst economic crisis after Baghdad severed its air links to the outside world and neighbouring Iran closed its border to trade in oil products .
Kirkuk lies outside the autonomous region but forms part of a swathe of historically Kurdish - majority territory that the Kurds want to incorporate in it against the wishes of Baghdad .

" Pakistan has been a partner to the United States at times .
We value and respect that .

US firms approach USTR against India's medical price control measures
Washington , Oct 18 ( PTI ) .
American companies producing medical devices and health information systems have approached the US Trade Representative against India's move to implement price controls on coronary stents and knee replacement implants that they say denying them equitable market access .
In a petition , the Advanced Medical Technology Association ( AdvaMed ) president and CEO Scott Whitaker requested the US Trade Representative ( USTR ) to " suspend or withdraw " India's benefits under Generalised System of Preferences ( GSP ) .
" AdvaMed and its members are deeply concerned about recently implemented price controls on coronary stents and knee replacement implants in India that have slashed prices by as much as 85 per cent and 70 per cent , respectively , followed by signals that price caps for additional life - saving and life - improving medical devices may be forthcoming , " Scott said .
Scott said that their intention was not for India to lose the benefits of GSP , but rather to advance engagement and meaningful discussions on restoring market access for medtech in India while keeping patients ?
interests at the center of all discussions .
Scott alleged that India's focus on controlling prices of high - quality medical devices , without any attempt to address the larger picture and correct inefficiencies in the health care system , would not achieve its intended benefits .
Recent reports indicate that the lowering of prices on medical devices ?
which are only one component of overall procedure costs ?
are not being passed along to patients .
Price controls may also block innovations and limit patient access to the best available care , he said .
Scott warned that failure to implement a mutually acceptable alternative could deter global organisations from making their latest products available to India ? s health care providers and patients , make Indian innovators less competitive in global markets , negatively impact future investment in India , and ultimately harm patients .
" We believe a stable and predictable market environment is key to driving investments in R & D , manufacturing , and other services to grow the medical technology industry in India , and meet the current and future needs of all of India's people , " he said .

" The Diwali festival will end on Saturday .
But , what about the ' diwala ' ( bankruptcy ) of the economy that has happened ?
Where is the diwali of ' achche din ' ?
Why there is no end to suicide by farmers ?

" I have to play difficult players early because I am ranked 12 now .
A lot of players who are ranked below me are getting good draws and before the match I was thinking ' Oh my God ' I am getting such tough draws .
But I know I have to beat tough players to come back to top - 10 again , " Saina told PTI .
" The World Championship taught me a lesson that I have to work even harder on my stamina .
I felt I was kind of tight in my hip and legs and of course my shots were also not sharp .
Looking at the way ( Nozomi ) Okuhara has improved , Carolina and Sindhu's improvement , the way they were playing big rallies , I am just happy to come a little close but I have a lot of improvement to be done , " she added .

Saina gave credit to the coaching staff headed by Pullela Gopichand for working on her after she shifted base from Bangalore to Hyderabad , following the World Championship .
She was training under Vimal Kumar for the last three years , which included her most difficult injury phase .
" The coaches worked really hard on me in the last three weeks .
They told me that my movements were very heavy .
Gopi sir found out at the World Championship that I was sort of falling down and I was not able to get up fast from the net and the players were catching me behind with fast tosses , " she said .
" He was scared that I had just come in and so he did not give me very tough training , they just focussed that I get adapted to the training , so he was not pushing me very hard .
All thanks to Mulyo ( Handoyo ) , Gopi sir and Hariawan , three of them made a plan for me , made me believe that I had the game and I just need to work on my movement and sharpen my strokes , basically think smarter and not go all out . "
A year ago , Saina had bowed out of the Rio Olympics after suffering from a knee problem and had to undergo a surgery .
But she fought back to not only recover but also win the World Championship bronze medal in August .
Asked if she has any targets for next year , Saina said : " I just want to think about one tournament at a time .
I don't trust my body nowadays , my body can do anything .
I am just happy with the kind of training I did in this tournament . "

Banking on settled batting and bowling combinations with most of the columns ticked , the hosts appear to be too well - groomed a unit for the comfort of the visitors .
Although India suffered a resounding loss to South Africa on a belter of a track at this very venue three seasons ago , they went on to win three series on the trot in their backyard and are now a force to reckon with in the upcoming series .
In fact , since surrendering to Australia back in 2009 - 10 , India have lost only to Pakistan ( 2012 ) and South Africa in 16 bilateral rubbers , a clear indication of how dominant they have been in familiar conditions .
Considering that the 4 - 1 result over Australia was achieved without skipper Virat Kohli being in top form and despite the absence of prolific opener Shikhar Dhawan , it was a huge achievement .
Vice - captain Rohit Sharma scored 296 runs , including a century and two fifties at an average just below 60 .
The ever - dependable Ajinkya Rahane hit 244 runs that included four half - centuries , while all - rounder Hardik Pandya amassed 222 runs .
The ever - reliable Mahendra Singh Dhoni had a subdued time with the bat against Australia .
If they continue to fire with the same intensity , it would be difficult for New Zealand to contain the home team on a Wankhede track , which is expected to provide the ideal pace and bounce for the batsmen to go for the shots .
With a new - look spin attack with Chinaman Kuldeep Singh and orthodox leggie Yuzvendra Chahal , along with the left - arm orthodox Axar Patel as the back - up , India's slow bowling too sports a supremely challenging look .
Among the pacers , Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Jasprit Bumrah are expected to trouble the Kiwis in the opening as well as at death overs .
However , New Zealanders will bank on their senior - most batsman and former captain Ross Taylor , who scored a cracking century at the Brabourne Stadium against the Indian Board President's XI in their second practice game .
The form of Taylor , opener Martin Guptill and captain Kane Williamson are going to be crucial in the Kiwis trying to match the Indian batting might .
Tom Latham , who also warmed up with a ton in the second practice game along with Taylor , offers some big - hitting option in the middle .
But overall , the visitors ' batting pales in comparison to the home team's , especially in sub - continental conditions .
The experienced pace duo of Trent Boult and Tim Southee will have to take up the responsibility of getting quick wickets at the top .
The spinners in left - arm orthodox Mitchell Santner and leggie Ish Sodhi may have a tough time against the Indian batsmen in the middle overs .
This will be the second series for India with the new ODI playing conditions after the one against Australia .
Squads :
India : Virat Kohli ( captain ) , Rohit Sharma , Shikhar Dhawan , Ajinkya Rahane , Manish Pandey , Kedar Jadhav , Dinesh Karthik , MS Dhoni ( wk ) , Hardik Pandya , Axar Patel , Kuldeep Yadav , Yuzvendra Chahal , Jasprit Bumrah , Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Shardul Thakur .
New Zealand : Kane Williamson ( captain ) , Trent Boult , Colin de Grandhomme , Martin Guptill , Matt Henry , Tom Latham , Henry Nicholls , Adam Milne , Colin Munro , Glenn Phillips , Mitchell Santner , Tim Southee , Ross Taylor , George Worker and Ish Sodhi .
Match commences at 1 : 30 pm IST .
US wants Myanmar to set conditions for return of Rohingya
Washington , Oct 23 ( PTI ) .
The US wants Myanmar to set conditions for the return of Rohingya Muslims as it believes that this " humanitarian catastrophe " can be used by some as a way to foment hatred along religious lines and then violence , a senior Trump administration official has said .
Nearly 600,000 minority Rohingya Muslims have fled to Bangladesh since late August to escape violence in Myanmar's Rakhine State where the army has launched a crackdown against militants .
Myanmar does not recognise Rohingya as an ethnic group and insists that they are Bangladeshi migrants living illegally in the country .
" It is a very significant humanitarian and security concern .
Because there are those who will use this humanitarian catastrophe as a way to foment hatred along religious lines and then violence , " the senior administration official told PTI .
" So , it's important for Myanmar to do more , to set conditions for the return of refugees , " said the official , who spoke on condition of anonymity .
As such it is important for the international communities do everything they can to alleviate the tremendous humanitarian suffering and to ensure that basic services , including education for children are met .
Meanwhile , the US government yesterday announced to have provided nearly USD 40 million in life - saving emergency assistance in direct response to the Rakhine State crisis since August 25 .
This brings the total US humanitarian assistance in 2017 to the displaced in Myanmar and the region to nearly USD 104 million , the State Department said .
The US assistance goes to its international organisation partners on the ground , including the UN High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR ) , the UN Children's Fund ( UNICEF ) , the International Organisation for Migration ( IOM ) and the World Food Programme ( WFP ) .
The organisations helps in providing protection , emergency shelter , food and nutritional assistance , as well as health care and psychosocial support for the more than half a million displaced refugees in Myanmar , Bangladesh and the region .
" We applaud Bangladesh's government generosity in responding to this severe humanitarian crisis and appreciate its continued efforts to ensure assistance reaches people in need , " the department said .
Welcoming Myanmar's commitment in bringing long - term peace and stability to Rakhine State by implementing the recommendations of the Kofi Annan - led Special Advisory Commission report , the department in a statement called for an immediate end of the violence in northern Rakhine State and for the Myanmar's government to allow refugees to return home voluntarily , safely and with dignity .
CISF to analyse social media trends for airports , nuclear bases security
New Delhi , Oct 23 ( PTI ) .
Social media trends and data analytics will be used for the first time in monitoring security at the country's most vital assets such as airports and nuclear and aerospace installations .
The Central Industrial Security Force , the national agency tasked to secure these important assets , has created a maiden ' media lab ' and social media monitoring control room - - the Pattern Research For Institutional Social Media ( PRISM ) analytics - - at its base in Arakkonam near Chennai .
A special team of CISF agents has been trained in the job of tracking social media trends , news , reports and indicators across various platforms , collate them and dish them out as vital pieces of " actionable intelligence " to its various airports and other vital units .
Social media platforms like Twitter , FaceBook , YouTube and Flickr will be used by the paramilitary force to check any suspicious and sabotage - like activity against the assets it guards .
The platform , developed by the IIT Delhi , is used by the Intelligence Bureau ( IB ) and the Mumbai Police to keep a check on security issues .
" We are doing this on an experimental basis .
The PRISM control room is based in the southern part of the country as we have a sizeable number of units that have our armed security cover in that part .
Based on the experiences , this smart centre will be further bolstered , " CISF Director General ( DG ) O P Singh told PTI .
He said that a special team of his men and women will keep a " track of social media trends " with the sole view of keeping their units such as airports , aerospace stations and nuclear bases safe .
" This is completely in - house .
We intend to link it to our WAR ( web analytics and resolution ) room that is already operational and based in Delhi , " Singh said .
Another senior CISF officer said , " The digital chatter in the world of social media is a great source for intelligence collection and timely action .
Public sentiment towards the force , behavioural pattern and predictable actions can be a great help to take timely action and avoid any mishap . "
A red flag would be raised , he said , in case of any posts that indicate any threat towards the units covered by the CISF or any potential harm that a force personnel would inflict upon self or others .
" The potential of this unique platform would be to avert even suicides in the force , to an extent as any sort of abnormal behaviour or posts would be an indicator for action to be taken .
" This would be done through features like sentiment analysis in - built in the software itself , " the official said .
The 1.80 lakh personnel - strong CISF is tasked to secure 59 airports and other vital installations under the command of the Union home ministry .

This Diwali , let's celebrate with animals , says NGO
Guwahati , Oct 18 ( PTI ) .
The festival of lights calls for celebrations and merrymaking .
Light diyas , burst crackers or party with family and friends , but do spare a thought for the animals and the birds that are as much a part of this society as we are .
Every year , loud sound from firecrackers causes stress , terror and even death in strays and birds .
This year will be no different , unless we become more responsible .
An Assam NGO is working overtime to spread awareness on how excruciating a firecracker can be to a dog or a bird .
" Diwali is a festival of twinkling lights , sweets , new clothes and plenty of fireworks for the humans .
But on the contrary , it causes trauma to pets and stray animals at large , " Sashanka Sekhar Dutta , the Managing Trustee of NGO ' Just Be Friendly ' ( JBF ) , told PTI .
To minimise their sufferings , JBF is trying its best to create awareness among people , he added .
" When lakhs of people celebrate the festival of lights , another part of the society bundle up in fear , " Dutta said .
He explained that dogs have an incredible hearing ability .
They can detect sounds at frequencies higher or lower than the audible range of an average person .
" Many puppies and even adult dogs get crushed under the wheels of the cars on the night of Diwali while trying to escape from the noise , " Dutta said .
It also causes temporary deafness in many animals and disorientation among the birds during night hours .
For some , these blaring noises may even lead to permanent loss of hearing .
He said the number of distress calls received by JBF is increasing every year with cases ranging from injury to deafness to skin problems .
" JBF attends to all calls for help and ensures proper treatment and care for the animals at their centre , " Dutta said .
Manas Ranjan Mahapatra , director ( culture and information ) of North Eastern Council , who owns a 10 - year - old Japanese Spitz is sceptical that this year , too , the sound from crackers might take a toll on his pet's health .
" All pets , including mine , react to firecrackers .
They start behaving abnormally .
Diwali should be celebrated with lights and not loud crackers , " he said .

A delegation led by Kerala's Health Minister K K Shylaja Kumari yesterday concluded a two - day visit to the University of Warwick in central England to explore how the general practitioner ( GP ) system has adapted to pressures caused by population changes , the university said in a statement .
Dean of Warwick Medical School Professor Sudhesh Kumar said his team was keen to assist the state government to understand how it was tackling issues such as " capacity development for primary care , translating research into practice and evaluating the impact of these interventions " .
We look forward to mutually beneficial collaborations with Kerala , Kumar said .
Kerala , which has the highest literacy rate and the highest life expectancy in India , is experiencing a rapidly aging population and an increase in non - communicable diseases such as diabetes .
To address these issues , the Kerala government is planning to establish training programmes to teach primary healthcare workers such as GPs and nurses .
The five - member delegation from the state also included State Health Secretary Rajeev Sadanandan , Director of Health Services Dr Sarita RL , Dean of Kerala University of Health Sciences Dr Harikumar Nair and member of the mission monitoring team of the chief minister of Kerala Dr Devkiran .
The delegation also visited the University Hospital of Coventry and Warwickshire ( UHCW ) NHS and local general practices in Coventry city centre , along with local clinicians and members of the academic unit for primary care at Warwick Medical School .
They now have plans to explore opportunities for collaboration with the University of Warwick for training and research .
The two - day event included talks on areas of training and research being conducted at Warwick Medical School , such as health issues in urban settlements , primary care and mental health resource in India , GP training and post - graduate training .
Professor Meghana Pandit , Chief Medical Officer and Deputy Chief Executive Officer of UHCW NHS Trust , showed the team around the university hospital , including their Surgical Training Centre , which provides training to Warwick Medical students as well as specialised training to experienced surgeons .
" We are proud of our partnership with the University of Warwick , and look forward to building closer links with Kerala as part of their collaborative work with the government , " she said .

Xi secures 2nd term as head of China's ruling Communist Party
Beijing , Oct 25 ( PTI ) .
Xi Jinping today secured a second five - year term as the head of the ruling Communist Party as it unveiled its new leadership with the Chinese president attaining iconic status enjoyed by modern China's founder Chairman Mao Zedong .
Xi , 64 , was elected in a closed - door vote to head the Politburo Standing Committee while Prime Minister Li Keqiang retained his seat on the ruling council alongside five new members .
Xi and Li walked along with members of the new Politburo Standing Committee before a media event telecast live all over world from Beijing's massive Great Hall of the People .
Five other men replaced comrades who had reached an informal retirement age of 68 .
Xi in a brief address , thanked the national and international media for working hard in reporting about the Congress .
He spoke about the China entering new era of modernisation .
" As I look ahead to the next five years , I see several important junctures and signposts , " Xi said .
Stating that the coming five years between the 19th and the 20th Party Congress is the period in which the timeframes of the two Centenary goals will converge , Xi said , " Not only we must deliver the first centenary goal , we must also embark on the journey towards the second centenary goal . "
" With decades of hard work , socialism with Chinese characteristics has entered a new era .
In this new context , we must get a new look and , more importantly , make new accomplishments , " he said .
" Peace and development are precious and should be valued .
The CPC will work with other countries for shared future and the noble cause of peace and development of all humanity , " he said .
Though the ruling Communist Party of China ( CPC ) is guided by the collective leadership principle , Xi who emerged as the post powerful leader with his ideological thoughts incorporated in the party constitution and declared earlier as " core leader " has acquired a higher status than other members of the Standing Committee and party , therefore expected to have his way on all policy matters .
Xi , who heads the party , presidency and the military has stamped his authority with massive anti - corruption campaign , the multi - billion dollar Belt and Road Initiative ( BRI ) to spread China ? s influence in the world .
The once - in - five - years Congress of the CPC on its final day yesterday approved Xi's ideology to be written into its Constitution , which is in addition to the title of " core leader " conferred on him last year that analysts say enhances his leadership status above other leaders of the party .
Till now , only the thoughts of Mao and his successor Deng Xiaoping were enshrined in the Constitution of the world's longest ruling Communist Party , interpreting the complex doctrine of Marxism with Chinese characteristics .
The thoughts of Deng , China's reformist leader , were added posthumously .
The thoughts of two of Xi's predecessors , Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao , were mentioned in the Constitution but not their names .
This makes Xi only the third leader to have his thoughts on governance enshrined , which will now be part of school textbooks all over China .
No ' Choti ' baat : Bihar girl wins int'l acclaim for enhancing Musahars ' lives
Patna , Oct 25 ( PTI ) .
A 20 - year - old girl from Bihar has made her native Bhojpur District proud by winning international acclaim for her efforts to uplift the Musahar community , considered one of the lowest and most downtrodden in the state ? s caste - ridden society .
Choti Kumari Singh , hailing from an impoverished upper caste Rajput family , has won ? Women's Creativity in Rural Life Award ?
from the Switzerland - based Women ? s World Summit Foundation .
Choti started helping with social and educational work among Musahars in her own village of Ratanpur in 2014 , after joining a programme run by the Mata Amritanandamayi Math of the spiritual leader Mata Amritanandamayi Devi ( Amma ) .
The programme aimed at adopting 101 villages across the country to make them self - reliant models of sustainability , according to a release issued by the Math .
Choti is the youngest person to receive the USD 1,000 ( Rs 65,000 approx . )
award since it was instituted in 1994 to honour women around the world exhibiting exceptional creativity , courage and commitment for the improvement of quality of life in rural communities .
Mostly working as landless labourers , the Musahar community suffers from poverty , near - total illiteracy and lack of personal hygiene .
Child marriages are rampant and school attendance is negligible .
When the programme was introduced at Ratnapur in 2014 , Choti started offering free after - school tuition classes for children .
" It was a herculean task to bring Musahar children to the classes because their parents did not show the slightest interest in educating them .
I went door to door gathering children and trying to convince the parents , ?
Choti says .
Choti initiated self - help groups wherein every woman saves Rs 20 a month , which is deposited in a common bank account for starting home - based activities .
The tuition classes proved to a huge success with 108 children enrolled .
This is no mean task in a village with a population of less than 1,000 people .
? Initially , the Musahar villagers were hostile .
They used to drink , gamble and verbally abuse me .
However , once they started observing the positive changes brought by our work , the situation became relatively favourable , ?
Choti recalls .
At the tuition centre , Choti began giving basic lessons in hygiene and cleanliness .
At first , the children were reluctant and habitually took bath only once a fortnight .
? I had a tough time making them sit through the classes .
Some of them even came to the class drunk .
But with time , their attitude changed , ?
The Mata Amritanandamayi Math has adopted five villages in Bihar and already commenced work in two of them ?
Ratanpur and Hadiabad .
Tuition classes were started in 2014 with students also participating in regular yoga and meditation sessions .
Free healthcare is being provided in these villages , and a trained health - worker is ensuring that all pregnant women get the required ante - natal care and that all newborn children are vaccinated .
The Math has installed hand pumps and helped women construct toilets .
Consequently , the two villages of Ratanpur and Hadiabad have been verified and declared as Open Defecation Free by the government ? s Swacch Bharat Abhiyan .
Hadiabad , in fact , became the first village in the entire Bhojpur District to gain this special status .

Leopard kills 11 - year - old near Katarniaghat Sanctuary in UP
Bahraich ( UP ) , Oct 25 ( PTI ) .
An 11 - year - old boy was dragged from his home and mauled to death by a leopard in a village adjoining the Katarniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary here , police said today .
Ram Sagar was at his house in Amritpur village last evening when the leopard entered through the door and dragged him out to the fields , they added .
The villagers tried to save Sagar from the leopard , the officials said , adding that his body was later recovered in the night .
The incident led to protests by the locals who alleged inaction on the part of the forest department even after three similar incidents in as many days in the area .
World Wildlife Fund ( WWF ) project officer Dabeer Hasan said the leopard's movement was detected in the area 15 days ago .
This region is regarded as a man - animal conflict - prone zone since leopards are present here in good numbers , he said .
Hasan said the forest department staff and NGOs have been apprising locals to remain vigilant .
The forest department will install three cages today to catch the leopard and tranquilisers will be used if required , he said .
In a similar incident on Sunday , a child was killed by a leopard in the same village and on Monday a leopard injured a child in another area of the sanctuary .
BCCI suspends Pune Curator after tampering claims in sting
schedule )
New Delhi / Pune , Oct 25 ( PTI ) .
The BCCI today suspended the curator of Pune's cricket stadium after he was seen on a TV sting operation claiming that he could tamper with the pitch ahead of the second India - New Zealand ODI .
However , the match , second of a three - game series , went ahead as scheduled after an ICC observer approved the track following an inspection .
Maharashtra Cricket Association President Abhay Apte made the announcement barely half an hour before the toss .
In the sting operation by India Today TV , curator Pandurang Salgaoncar is seen and heard speaking to an undercover reporter , who poses as a bookie , while standing on the pitch of the Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium .
The 68 - year - old Salgaoncar is seen agreeing to tamper with the pitch to suit the requirements put forth by the reporter .
India Today TV said the video was shot last evening .
It is not clear how Salgaoncar , a former pacer and one - time India prospect , could have tweaked the pitch with just a few hours to go before the match later today .
" Pandurang Salgaoncar has been suspended from the Maharashtra Cricket Association's curator's post with immediate effect , " BCCI acting Secretary Amitabh Chaudhary told PTI .
" The MCA has also suspended Salgaoncar from all other positions in the association .
An inquiry Commission will also be constituted by MCA .
At BCCI , we reiterate that we have zero tolerance towards any corrupt activity , " he added .
What has left senior BCCI officials baffled is that Salgaoncar allowed a self - confessed bookie to accompany him to the main match pitch .
Under BCCI rules no unaccredited persons , including journalists , are allowed near the pitch .
" The BCCI Anti - Corruption Unit ( ACU ) under Neeraj Kumar will have some answering to do .
Here a random man comes , doesn't have an all - access area pass and is taken to the main pitch by the curator , " a BCCI official said .
Asked if the ACU unit should be answerable as to how an outsider got access to the pitch , Chaudhary said , " . . . everyone associated with the ACU would be answerable .
In any case a very select few have access to the centre of the pitch . "
When contacted , BCCI acting President C K Khanna said he is writing a mail to Kumar so that his team gives an update on the incident .
" It's a pity that both former MCA President Ajay Shirke and current president Abhay Apte had helped Salgaoncar have a career after retirement .
He gets Rs 65,000 salary per month from the MCA and also a BCCI pension .
He is among BCCI's independent curators .
We are feeling bad for both Abhay and Ajay .
Salgaoncar let them down badly , " added an official .
Salgaoncar , a former Maharashtra speedster , was considered a genuine India prospect in early and mid ' 70s .
He toured with the Indian team for an unofficial series against Sri Lanka back in 1974 .
Sunil Gavaskar's autobiography ' Sunny Days ' mentions him as being a genuine prospect who was unlucky not to don national colours .
The former pacer took 214 wickets in 63 first - class games .
The Pune pitch had been under the spotlight earlier as well .
It had been rated poor by the ICC after an India - Australia Test match in February .
The Australians had hammered India by 333 runs on a turner where the home team was bowled out for 105 and 107 in two innings .
The game itself had ended inside three days .
Former India captain Sourav Ganguly also expressed his shock .
" I don't know how he can tweak the pitch in one day and prepare it accordingly for a bookie .
I don't know in what context he was saying this , " Ganguly said .
Centre to invest Rs 6000 crore to improve quality of ITIs
Shillong , Oct 25 ( PTI ) .
Union Minister Anant Kumar Hegde today said the Centre will invest Rs 6000 crore in association with the World Bank to improve the quality of the Industrial Training Institutes ( ITIs ) across the country .
The Union Minister of State for Skill Development and Entrepreneurship said the Centre wants to take these ITIs to every community and rural development block in the country
" To strengthen these ITI ? s we have started a new scheme with an investment of around 6000 crore in coordination with World Bank to improve quality of some institution which are performing good .
In rural areas also we are planning to take ITIs there , " he told PTI at the sideline of an inspection of the ITI centre here .
Hegde said the Centre was forced to de - affiliate around 400 ITIs due to their poor and deteriorating quality .
" It has come to my knowledge that ITI quality is substandard , we were forced to disaffiliate few ITIs since the quality is not good , " he said .
The Union minister was here to take stock of functioning of various ITIs and also took feedback from the people about the functioning of these institutes in the state besides other skill development institute in the region .
The Skill Development Ministry has begun monitoring the ITIs with a view to maintaining their quality standards and also introduced voluntary self grading by the institutes .
Girija Devi's wish for a music academy remained unfulfilled
Mona Parthsarathi
Varanasi , Oct 25 ( PTI ) .
She might have made Kolkata her home but her birthplace Kashi always had a special place in Thumri queen Girija Devi's heart .
The legendary classical singer and a doyen of Banaras Gharana , Devi , who passed away at the age of 88 in Kolkata last night , wanted to build a world - class music academy here , a wish that remained unfulfilled .
" I have been asking for land for a music academy in Varanasi for the past 50 years but the government never paid attention .
I could not get any land for the proposed academy .
If I was given the land , I would have built a world class academy of music here , " Devi had told PTI in an interview a few years ago .
" If there was an academy in Varanasi , I would not have settled in Kolkata , " Devi , who was a faculty member of ITC Music Research Academy .
The singer , affectionately known to people as ' Appaji ' , had also expressed a desire to speak to Prime Minister Narendra Modi in this regard as Varanasi is his constituency .
Meanwhile , Devi's death has shocked the artistes in the city with many calling it a huge loss to the Indian classic music .
Renowned vocalist Pandit Channu Lal Mishra echoed Devi's sentiments about a music academy in the city to keep its rich musical tradition alive .
" Girija Devi was one of the gems of Banaras .
Her heart always beat for the city .
This culturally rich city needs an academy for music to keep its traditions alive .
A centre where students can live and understand Banarasi Sangeet , " he told PTI .
Revati Sakalkar , vocal music faculty member at Banaras Hindu University , said Devi's demise has robbed the city of its ' sur ' ( note ) .
" Shankar's Kashi will not be the same without Girija ( another name of Goddess Parvati ) .
We artistes feel that vaccume .
She was the pride and joy of not just Kashi but the entire country , " she said .
Devi's disciple Sakalkar said , " Kashi has given Ustad Bismillah Khan , Girija Devi and Birju Maharaj to the world .
There should definitely be a world - class academy to keep the ' guru - shishya parampara ' alive . "
Soma Ghosh , another vocalist and adopted daughter of Bismillah Khan , said that such an academy should have been built when she was alive .
" There is nothing left in Kashi now .
Those who want to learn music are compelled to move to other cities .
We have lost baba ( Bismillah Khan ) and now Appaji who had so much to teach , " She said .
PSU bank recap plan ' monumental step forward ' : RBI Guv
New Delhi , Oct 25 ( PTI ) .
Reserve Bank Governor Urjit Patel today said the Rs 2.11 lakh crore bank recapitalisation plan is a ' monumental step forward ' in safeguarding India's economic future and a comprehensive policy would be put in place to address the challenges faced by the sector .
Finance Minister Arun Jaitley yesterday announced that Rs 2.11 lakh crore would be infused in PSU banks over two years , of which Rs 1.35 lakh crore will be through recapitalisation bonds .
The remaining Rs 76,000 crore would be from the budgetary support and market raising .
Welcoming the government's decision , Patel in a statement said that a well - capitalised banking system is a pre - requisite for stable economic growth .
" Economic history has shown us repeatedly that it is only healthy banks that lend to healthy firms and borrowers , creating a virtuous cycle of investment and job creation .
The Government of India's decisive package to restore the health of the Indian banking system is in the view of the Reserve Bank of India , a monumental step forward in safeguarding the country ? s economic future , " he said .
Non - performing assets ( NPAs ) of banks have more than doubled to Rs 7.33 lakh crore in June 2017 from Rs 2.75 lakh crore in March 2015 .
" For the first time in last decade , we now have a real chance that all the policy pieces of the jigsaw puzzle will be in place for a comprehensive and coherent , rather than piece - meal , strategy to address the banking sector challenges , " Patel said .
Outlining the ' desirable features ' of the recapitalisation package , Patel said the recapitalisation bonds will front - load capital injections while staggering the fiscal implications over a period of time .
" As such , the recapitalisation bonds will be liquidity neutral for the government except for the interest expense that will contribute to the annual fiscal deficit numbers , " the governor said .
Jaitley yesterday said that the impact of the recapitalisation bond on fiscal deficit would depend on the nature of the bond and who issues it .
The interest burden on the government for issuing recapitalisation bond would be about Rs 8,000 - 9,000 crore , according to Chief Economic Advisor Arvind Subramanian .
Patel said these bonds would involve participation of private shareholders of PSU banks by requiring that parts of the capital needs be met by market funding .
" Last but not the least , it will allow for a calibrated approach whereby banks that have better addressed their balance - sheet issues and are in a position to use fresh capital injection for immediate credit creation can be given priority while others shape up to be in a similar position , " he said .
The issuance of bonds would provide for a good way of bringing some market discipline into a public recapitalisation programme compared to the past recapitalisation programmes .
Financial sector policies should support growth while maintaining financial stability , Patel said .
" I commend the government on its bold steps in this direction , starting with implementation of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code that is helping resolve the underlying corporate stress , and culminating in yesterday's announcement of the public sector bank recapitalisation programme , " Patel said .
The RBI would work with the government to ensure these plans reach their natural completion to the benefit of the broader Indian economy , he added .

Most hospitals in Arunachal don't have facilities for disposal of bio - medical wastes : CAG
Itanagar , Oct 25 ( PTI ) .
Most of the hospitals and nursing homes in Arunachal Pradesh don't have facilities for disposal of bio - medical wastes , according to a recent report by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India .
The CAG report which was tabled in the state assembly this month highlighted that in 10 government hospitals treatment plants were installed .
But they remained non - functional due to lack of trained manpower , technical defects , lack of fund for maintenance besides shortage of power .
The Centre had framed the Bio - Medical Waste ( Management and Handling ) Rules 1998 under the provision of Environment ( Protection ) Act , 1986 which prescribed the procedures for treatment and disposal of bio - medical waste generated by hospitals , nursing homes , dispensaries and clinics .
The report highlighted various drawbacks with the Arunachal Pradesh State Pollution Control Board ( APSPCB ) as the board did not have the state level data on health care establishments which is required for compliance of rules and regulations of the Bio - Medical Waste .
The report pointed out that out of only 12 out of 437 health care establishments are functioning with authorisation issued by the APSPCB .
The report further stated that 12 hospitals inspected did not observe the standards prescribed in the rules for disposal of bio - medical waste .
The CAG findings revealed that in the state hospital at Naharlagun , near here , bio - medical waste treatment plant was installed in June 2004 at a cost of Rs 70.88 lakh under central assistance was subsequently dismantled in June 2012 to accommodate construction of 300 bedded hospital at the site and no replacement had been provided since then .
In general hospital Pasighat , where the plant was installed on June 2004 at a cost of Rs 70.88 lakh , was lying idle since September 2009 due to technical defects , it said .
Subsequently , another plant at a cost of Rs 68.50 lakh funded under National Rural Health Mission was approved in December 2013 but remained incomplete even after two years of its sanction , the report said .
Another treatment plant installed at General Hospital Aalo at a cost of Rs 22.89 lakh in 2009 under NRHM , was not functional since its installation due to unsatisfactory installation and lack of trained operator .
The plant was dismantled and a new plant at a cost of Rs 50 lakh taken under NRHM during 2015 - 16 remained incomplete .
Similar was the fate of the plants installed in General Hospitals at Ziro , Bomdila , Tezu and Khonsa , the report added .
The report further stated that a joint inspection of 12 test checked hospitals was conducted with representatives of APSPCB and the hospital authorities where it was revealed number of deviations from the prescribed procedure for disposal of bio - medical waste .
In some hospitals , bio - medical waste were disposed with solid waste and in some government hospitals the waste were disposed of by burning in open space in hospital premises or disposed of by burning in local made chullah in hospital premises .
The CAG report has recommended the state government to adopt mechanism for enlisting all the health care establishments functioning in the state for issue of authorisation and effective monitoring of their functioning .
It also suggested for preparing a detail plan for establishment of bio - medical waste treatment plants in government hospitals and also takes necessary steps to operationalise the existing idle plants through budgetary provisions .
The report further suggested the government for ensuring that all the health care establishments dispose bio - medical waste in compliance with the prescribed standards to prevent adverse effect on human health and environment .

Hyderabad , Oct 25 ( PTI ) .
A day after cross - country woman motorcycle rider Sana Iqbal died in a car crash , her mother today alleged that it was a " pre - planned murder " which the deceased's husband was trying to portray as an accident .

Twenty - nine - year - old Iqbal , who undertook a solo expedition to raise awareness about suicide and depression , died while her husband , Abdul Nadeem , suffered injuries in the car crash in the early hours yesterday when they were heading home in Tolichowki area here , according to the police .
Nadeem , who was driving the car , lost control over the wheels and the vehicle rammed the median on the Outer Ring Road , Narsingi Police Station Inspector G V Ramana Goud said .
A case was later registered for causing death by negligence and other relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code , the police said .
However , Iqbal's mother alleged that her daughter was murdered and that it was being projected as an accident .
" Yesterday , he ( Iqbal's husband ) planned it in such ( a way ) that . . . and gave it a turn as an accident .
But , it was a pre - planned , well organised and a cold - blooded murder , " Iqbal's mother alleged .
Deputy Commissioner of Police ( Madhapur zone ) Vishwa Prasad told PTI that as per the preliminary investigation , it was a road accident and there was no suspicion over it .
" Her husband has also suffered severe injuries after their car hit the median and turned turtle , " the DCP said .
He , however , said they will also verify the allegations of the Iqbal's mother .
Inspector Goud said as per their investigation it was an accident .
He said Iqbal's mother has complained to the police alleging it was a pre - planned murder and that they have told her and other family members to produce an evidence for it .
Last month , Iqbal had sent a message from her phone to a few friends and family members purportedly saying her life was in danger and that her husband or in - laws should be held responsible in case she died of a heart attack or a brain stroke , the police official said .
" There may have been some dispute between Iqbal and her husband .
The message was sent at that time and it has no connection with the road accident , " Goud said .
The Hyderabad - based rider hit the headlines a few years ago when she undertook the solo motorcycle expedition across the country .
The focus of her campaign was to educate people , particularly students , against committing suicide .
She was also a professional trainer and a student of psychology , and had addressed thousands of students in colleges .

First Jurassic - era ' fish lizard ' fossil found in India
Berlin / New Delhi , Oct 26 ( PTI ) .
In a first , a near - complete fossilised skeleton of a Jurassic ichthyosaur - large marine reptile which lived alongside dinosaurs - has been discovered in India , scientists said .
Fossil records of ichthyosaurs , which means ' fish lizards ' in Greek , have been found in North American and Europe previously .
However , in the Southern Hemisphere , they have mostly been limited to South America and Australia .
Researchers including those from the University of Delhi and University of Erlangen - Nuremberg ( FAU ) in Germany have found what they believe to be the first Jurassic ichthyosaur in India , from the Kachchh area in Gujarat .
The near - complete skeleton , nearly 5.5 metre long , is thought to belong to the Ophthalmosauridae family , which likely lived between around 165 and 90 million years ago .
It was found among fossils of ammonites and squid - like belemnites , and its tooth wear patterns suggest it predated such hard , abrasive animals .
" This is a remarkable discovery not only because it is the first Jurassic ichthyosaur record from India , but also it throws light on the evolution and diversity of ichthyosaurs in the Indo - Madagascan region of the former Gondwanaland and India's biological connectivity with other continents in the Jurassic , " said Guntupalli Prasad , from the Department of Geology in University of Delhi .
While the study , published in the journal PLOS ONE , has not yet been able to pinpoint the ichthyosaur's species , researchers believe that a full identification could inform on possible ophthalmosaurid dispersal between India and South America .
They hope that unearthing more Jurassic vertebrates in this region could provide further insights into the evolution of marine reptiles in this part of the globe .
Our bowlers did half the job : Dhawan
Pune , Oct 26 ( PTI ) .
Opener Shikhar Dhawan credited the bowlers for India's six - wicket win , saying they did half the job by restricting New Zealand to a modest total in the second one - dayer here .
India under pressure produced a professional performance to beat the Kiwis by six wickets to level the three - match series 1 - 1 .
The series decider will be played in Kanpur on October 29 .
Shikhar's 68 and an unbeaten 64 by Dinesh Karthik saw India overhaul the modest 230 - run target with four overs to spare at the Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium here .
" Absolutely , 230 is not too much in these times .
The bowlers bowled really well and the fielders backed them up well .
The bowlers had done half the job actually for us .
The pressure of chasing 230 is naturally always less compared to chasing 300 .
It's good we are on a winning run , " Dhawan told reporters at the post match media briefing .
" There was no seam movement when India bowled and the Indian bowlers bowled very tight lines and did the job for us .
We played their pacers better than they played our pacers , " added the 31 - year - old Delhi batsman .
Dhawan also heaped praise on pacer Bhuvneshwar Kumar , who returned with impressive figures of 3 - 45 .
" He ( Bhuvneshwar ) has raised his bar and I feel he is at a very high level .
His control over the bowling is very good .
Not just at the start but other variations .
Even when he bowls slower ball and knuckle ball he makes sure he lands it in the right areas , " he said .
" The way he got that left - hander out ( Colin Munro ) , it was because he pitched that ball in the right area and even when comes in the death over , he is the best bowler .
Best bowler in the world I guess , the way he bowls Yorkers .
" I have seen him in the IPL and in the Indian team , he has bowled consistently well .
He has improved a lot .
And I feel that he has got a lot of belief in himself and that's what is showing out there , " added Dhawan , who was Bhuvi's team mate in Sunrisers Hyderabad in the IPL .
Dhawan also showered praise on Dinesh Karthik , saying his skills of rotating the strike makes him one of the best middle - order batsman .
" About Dinesh I will say that he has worked hard and scored so many runs in domestic ( cricket ) that he is being rewarded for that and has made a place in the team again .
He is one of the best middle order player , with the skills and shots he has and he is proving himself .
" The way he played the knock today and in the last game when the team was in trouble , his 30 - 35 runs , were beneficial .
When he bats , his strike rotation is good , which reduces pressure on the other batsman .
" Like today , I wasn't able to rotate the strike , but Dinesh was doing that , so I was not pressurized .
So it benefits the team if a player like him rotates the strike as soon as he comes , " said Dhawan , who notched up his 22nd ODI fifty in the game .
Dhawan said the team management decided to send Hardik Pandya up the order to put pressure on the Kiwis .
" Dinesh has been doing well and they ( the team management ) wanted to send Hardik ( up the order ) and take the game away from the opposition and that's what Hardik was trying out there and it went our way , " he added .
" I was a bit surprised with their decision to bat first because there could be dew in the evening usually during this time .
But it wasn't a bad track to bat on even in the first innings also , it was a good wicket .
" When we were batting we thought it slowed down a bit , the ball wasn't coming that nicely the way it should come , " Dhawan signed off .

NIA carries out searches at residence of Salahuddin's son
New Delhi , Oct 26 ( PTI ) .
The National Investigation Agency ( NIA ) today carried out searches at the residence of Syed Shahid Yousuf , son of Hizbul Mujahideen chief Syed Salahuddin , at Budgam in central Kashmir and seized phones , laptops and other documents , officials said .
Shahid , who was arrested by the NIA on October 24 for allegedly receiving funds from overseas for subversive activities in the Kashmir Valley , is at present in the custody of the agency for seven days .
NIA officials said a team of the agency sleuths carried out searches at Shahid's residence at Soibug in Budgam district of central Kashmir and seized his five mobile phones , a laptop and some incriminating documents .
According to NIA , 42 - year - old Shahid , who works in the agricultural department of the Jammu and Kashmir government , has given the names of overseas Hizbul Mujahideen members involved in fund - raising for the terror outfit .
The NIA claimed during questioning that Shahid " admitted to having received funds from cadres of the Hizbul Mujahideen on the direction of his father , Mohammed Yusuf Shah alias Syed Salahuddin , for fomenting terrorist activities in the Valley " .
The NIA said he also " revealed the names of his associates abroad who were linked with the Mujahideen and involved in raising , collecting and transferring funds from other countries to India " .
It alleged that Shahid used to receive funds through a US - based international wire transfer company from Aijaz Ahmed Bhat , another accused in the case who is absconding and is based in Saudi Arabia .
The agency alleged that Shahid was " one of several Indian contacts of Bhat " who had been in telephonic contact with him for receiving money transfer codes .
The NIA claimed so far he had received a total of nearly Rs 4.5 lakh through eight international wire transfers .
The case , registered by the NIA in April 2011 , relates to the transfer of money from Pakistan to Jammu and Kashmir through hawala channels via Delhi , which the agency believed was used in funding terrorism and secessionist activities .
The NIA has so far filed two charge sheets against six people including G M Bhat , a close aide of pro - Pakistan separatist Syed Ali Shah Geelani , Mohammed Siddiq Ganai , Ghulam Jeelani Liloo and Farooq Ahmed Dagga .
All four are in judicial custody .
Two others - - Mohammed Maqbool Pandit and Bhat - - were also charge sheeted by the NIA but are absconding .
An Interpol Red Corner notice has been issued against them .
Shahid's father Salahuddin , based in Pakistan , was declared a Specially Designated Global Terrorist by the US Department of State in June this year .
Besides heading terror outfit Hizbul Mujahideen , he is the chairman of the United Jehad Council ( UJC ) , a conglomerate of terrorist outfits operating in the Kashmir Valley .
Losing 3 wickets early put us under pressure : Santner
Pune , Oct 26 ( PTI ) .
New Zealand spinner Mitchell Santner said losing three early wickets put his team under pressure and they ended up posting a below par total against India in the second one - dayer here .
India pace duo of Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Jasprit Bumrah wreaked havoc on the Kiwi top order removing openers Martin Guptill , Colin Munro and one down skipper Kane Williamson cheaply inside the first 10 overs .
" Obviously it's a little bit disappointing .
I think credit has to go to India the way they bowled in the start and put us under pressure , " the left - arm spinner told reporters at the post - match media conference here last night .
" Losing the first three in the first 10 overs is not ideal if you're batting first . "
India dished out a clinical performance to outclass New Zealand by six wickets and level the series 1 - 1 with now the series decider to be played in Kanpur on October 29 .
India batsman Shikhar Dhawan ( 68 ) and Dinesh Karthik ( 64 ) struck timely half centuries as India chased the target without much fuss .
" We knew that 230 was a little under - par and then the way they came out and batted I guess took the game away from us .
Shikhar ( Dhawan ) played pretty well and finished off with ( Dinesh ) Karthik in the end , " said Santner .
Last year , New Zealand faltered in the fifth ODI at Visakhapatnam after leveling the series 2 - 2 and Santner said his team will look to not repeat the mistake when they play in the third and final game at Kanpur .
" It's a bit disappointing with the loss tonight but we've learnt our part going to Kanpur .
We're hoping to take the series 2 - 1 , " he said .
" Last year we didn't put in a great performance to lose it 3 - 2 but I guess we can hit the ball rolling at Kanpur and then hopefully take the series 2 - 1 . "
Santner , who also played in last year's series , conceded that Indian batsmen played spin very well .
" They're very good players of spin and the Indian players have grown up playing a lot of spin so it makes your job a lot tougher , " he said .
" I think my job is to be quite economical and try taking wickets through the middle and if I can take a few that helps but I guess today ( last night ) they chased their total pretty well . "
N Korea's Kim wishes Xi ' great success '
Seoul , Oct 26 ( AFP ) .
North Korean leader Kim Jong - Un wished his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping " great success " in a congratulatory but comparatively restrained message after he cemented his grip on power at a landmark Communist Party Congress .
Kim's note extended " sincere congratulations " to the Chinese president , who was formally given a second term as the head of the ruling party , state - run KCNA said today .
The message , sent Wednesday , also " expressed conviction that the relations between the two parties and the two countries would develop in the interests of the peoples of the two countries , " KCNA said .
But the brief , four - sentence missive was a notable contrast to the fulsome terms in which Kim praised the Chinese leader and his country when Xi ascended to power five years ago .
Ties between the two neighbours have soured in recent years as the North staged a series of nuclear tests and missile launches despite opposition by Beijing - - its sole diplomatic ally and economic lifeline .
In 2012 Kim described the two nations as " friendly neighbours linked by the same mountain and rivers " and bilateral ties as the " common precious wealth associated with the wisdom and efforts of the leaders of the elder generations " .
Beijing has been reluctant to slap sanctions harsh enough to rattle the North's political status quo over fears that its collapse could send an influx of refugees across their shared border and place the US army at China's doorstep .
But in a sign of irritation at its unpredictable neighbour , Beijing cut all its coal imports from the North earlier this year and voted in favour of broader UN sanctions imposed on Pyongyang in recent months .

Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath will visit the Taj Mahal today against the backdrop of various controversial statements made by some BJP leaders and ministers against the 17th century monument .
Over 14,000 policemen have been deployed across the city for the security of Adityanath , who arrived here early this morning .
Adityanath will be the first BJP CM of UP to visit the monument of love .
The chief minister , who landed in the city ? s Kheria Airport , went to Nangla Paima village and visited the rubber check dam .
He also visited Kachhpura village .
A senior police officer told PTI that more than 14,000 policemen have been deployed across the city for the security of the CM .
? The monument is open for tourists and the entry will be allowed as per the routine process .
The security has been stepped up , ?
he said .
According to his programme , Adityanath will stay for half an hour at the graves of Shah Jahan and Mumtaz Mahal and visit the Shah Jahan park nearby .
The chief minister will inspect various places along the way , inside and outside the monument .
He will also lay foundation for the development of a tourist pathway from the Taj Mahal to the Agra Fort .
He will also run a mega cleanliness campaign along with 500 BJP activisits and social workers around the west gate of the Taj Mahal .
The chief minister has already declared that the state government will spend Rs 370 crore on development plans aimed at promoting tourism in the city of Taj .
Along with the visit to the Taj Mahal , Adityanath will inaugurate various development projects in Agra , according to an official spokesman .
" During his tour of Agra . . , the chief minister will be visiting all the places inside Taj Mahal , " principal secretary , tourism , Awanish Awasthi said yesterday .
His decision to visit the Taj Mahal was announced after a series of controversies erupted , beginning with a UP tourism department booklet not mentioning the monument in its list of development projects in the state .
Subsequently , BJP MLA Sangeet Som called Taj Mahal a " blot on Indian history " and BJP MP Vinay Katiyar said it was originally a Shiva temple .
However , addressing a rally in Gorakhpur recently , Adityanath called Taj Mahal the " pride of India " and referred to it as a " world class monument " .
This was a significant departure from his remarks at a rally in Bihar last year , when he had said that the Taj does not represent Indian culture and that visiting foreign dignitaries should be presented with the Gita rather than replicas of Taj Mahal .
The last time a UP CM visited the Taj was Akhilesh Yadav , more than two years back .
That was the Valentine's Day and Akhilesh sat on one of the benches in front of the monument along with his wife and Kannauj MP Dimple Yadav .

Texas Department of Family and Protective Services spokesperson confirmed that Mathews ' four - year - old daughter remains in foster care .
Richardson Police had no immediate comment to the statement .
The police previously said Sini Mathews initially cooperated in the investigation on October 7 , but then stopped .
This week , police said Mathews provided dental records and identified clothing found with Sherin's body in order to help the medical examiner make a positive ID .
Police also said Mathews never provided a full account of what happened when Sherin died .
Wesley Mathews is the only person charged with a crime in Sherin's disappearance and death .
On Monday , police arrested him for a second time on an injury to a child charge after he told them that Sherin choked on milk .
According to court records , Wesley Mathews previously told detectives his wife was sleeping when Sherin disappeared .
Earlier , Wesley Mathews , was booked into to the Dallas County Jail yesterday and has been placed under suicide watch .
Mathews originally told police his daughter Sherin disappeared while being punished , when she was forced to stand outside by a tree at 3 am for not drinking her milk .
Later when the body was found , he changed his story and said that his daughter choked to death after he " physically assisted " her in drinking her milk .
Meanwhile , a petition has been started by community leader Father Thomas to not hand over the body of Sherin Mathews to her parents , and rather to the community , so that proper memorial and burial service could be done .

By Lalit K Jha ?
Washington , Oct 26 ( PTI ) .
US President Donald Trump has slammed his Democratic presidential rival Hillary Clinton after news reports appeared that her campaign had funded research that resulted in a dossier which contained allegations that he had links with the Russians .
" It's a disgrace .
It's a very sad commentary on politics in this country , " Trump told reporters at the White House yesterday .
First reported by The Washington Post , the dossier prepared by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele and Fusion GPS has now has become a central focus of ongoing congressional probes into Russian election interference during the 2016 general election .
?
" I think it's very sad what they've done with this fake dossier .
It was made up , and I understand they paid a tremendous amount of money , and Hillary Clinton always denied it .
The Democrats always denied it .
Now only because it's going to come out in a court case , they said , yes , they did it .
They admitted it , and they're embarrassed by it , " Trump said .
He said the whole Russian thing has now turned out to be a hoax .
" This was the Democrats coming up with an excuse for losing an election . . . They didn't know what to say , so they made up the whole Russia hoax .
" Now it's turning out that the hoax has turned around .
And you look at what's happened with Russia , and you look at the uranium deal , and you look at the fake dossier .
So that's all turned around , " he said in response to another question .
Trump said the uranium sale to Russia and the way it was done , " with tremendous amounts of money being passed , I actually think that's Watergate , modern age . "
According to The Hill , the news has created a problem for Democrats , as the report shows the Democratic presidential campaign ? funded a foreign ? spy's opposition research an accusation similar to complaints that Democrats have brought against Trump's campaign .
The Republican National Committee chairwoman Dana McDaniel told Fox News that it is incredibly concerning that the DNC and the Clinton campaign funded this Fusion GPS through a third party .
" They touted this fake Russia dossier through Washington , tried to push it into news outlets .
It ended up being the basis of some of the Comey investigation , " she alleged .
" They never owned up to the fact that they were behind it .
They've lied about it , now they're playing hot potato .
We need to get to the bottom of why they did this , how they funded it .
And there's ? a lot of questions that need to be answered by the Clinton campaign and the DNC , " she said .
The Washington Post said Clinton and top officials of her presidential campaign were largely silent in response to the damaging revelation .

Trump congratulates Xi after Chinese leader tightens grip on power
Washington , Oct 26 ( AFP ) .
President Donald Trump has congratulated Xi Jinping , after the Chinese leader solidified his grip on power at a landmark Communist Party Congress .
" Spoke to President Xi of China to congratulate him on his extraordinary elevation .
Also discussed NoKo & trade , two very important subjects ! "
Trump tweeted after the call yesterday .
The phone call came as Xi was formally handed a second term in power and his doctrine was written into the party constitution - - putting him on par with the nation's founder Mao Zedong .
The party meeting also saw the Chinese leader fuel speculation about how long he will remain in the post by not anointing a possible successor to take over in five years ' time .
China's state - run news agency Xinhua reported that Xi expressed a desire to work with Trump to " jointly blueprint future development of China - US ties . "
Trump is expected to meet the Chinese leader during a state visit to China early next month .
That is part of a broader Asia trip likely to be dominated by concerns about North Korea's ballistic and nuclear programs .
Successive White Houses have viewed Xi's meteoric rise to become China's most powerful leader since Deng Xiaoping with cautious optimism .
They hope it will lead to more streamlined decision making and see benefits in having an interlocutor who can afford to take some risks domestically .
A senior aide to Trump said " the president has a very good working relationship with Xi Jinping .
He wants to continue building on what the president terms a constructive and results - oriented relationship . "
" The 19th Party Congress provides the opportunity for us to get some things done in the relationship to put us on a good footing deep into the future . "

TN urges PM to get fishermen , boats released from Lanka
Chennai , Oct 28 ( PTI ) .
Tamil Nadu Chief Minister K Palaniswami has urged the Centre to take immediate steps to secure the release of 54 Indian fishermen apprehended by Sri Lanka .
140 fishing boats are also in Sri Lanka's custody and this is fuelling unrest among the fisher folk , he noted .
" I strongly urge you to . . . take up the alarming and frequent abduction of our fishermen in their traditional waters with the highest authorities in the Sri Lankan government , " he said in a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi yesterday .
He appealed to Modi to ensure the safety and security of Indian fishermen in the Palk Bay .
Palaniswami said recently 46 fishermen and their nine mechanised fishing boats were apprehended in separate incidents .
The fishermen had set sail from Ramanathapuram and Pudukottai districts of Tamil Nadu .
They were apprehended by the Sri Lankan Navy between September 11 and October 26 , he said in the letter .
" So far , in 2017 , 317 Tamil Nadu fishermen and 62 fishing boats have been apprehended in 59 incidents and 263 of these fishermen have been released after considerable persuasion by the governments of India and Tamil Nadu , " he noted .

India ' very strongly ' raises H - 1B visa issue with US : Prabhu
Washington , Oct 28 ( PTI ) .
India has " very strongly " raised the issue of H - 1B and L1 visas with the US , Union Minister Suresh Prabhu said today , asserting that the American economy will find it difficult to cope with the reality as it has been immensely benefited by Indian IT professionals .
The US has tightened the norms for issuing the most sought - after H - 1B and L1 visas in line with the Trump administration's goal to protect American workers from discrimination and replacement by foreign labour .
In a new directive , the Trump administration this week made it more difficult for the renewal of H - 1B and L1 , popular among Indian IT professionals , saying that the burden of proof lies on the applicant even when an extension is sought .
Under the current US rules , Indian IT professionals working in the US on H - 1B visas do not get back their hard - earned contribution to Social Security , which runs into at least more than USD 1 billion per annum .
" We raised very strongly the issue of Indian professionals and H - 1B and L1 visa issues , " Prabhu said after the first US - India bilateral Trade Policy Forum ( TPF ) under the Trump administration which was also attended by US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer .
" We explained to them that we are not raising this issue because Indians will find it difficult to come , because US economy itself will find it difficult to cope with the reality because the US has immensely benefited by IT professionals penetrating into the market by offering services that has improved their productivity , " Prabhu said .
Batting for Indian IT companies , he also strongly raised the issue of totalisation .
" I hope they will look into the issue , " Prabhu said , as he pointed out towards the issue of mismatch between US visa and US social security regimes , wherein Indian professionals making social security contributions do not receive their due benefits upon their return to India .
Meanwhile , the US and India have also agreed to address the issue of trade deficit by increasing and diversifying bilateral trade , the minister said as he sought easing of procedures for export of mangoes and pomegranates to the US .
Taking note of America's concern on price controls on medical devices , Prabhu , during his meetings with Lighthizer on Thursday , encouraged US companies to take benefit of the " Make in India " policy and establish manufacturing facilities in India which would considerably bring down the cost .
During the inaugural India - US Commercial dialogue , US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross stressed on the need to increase bilateral trade between the two countries to address the issue of trade imbalance , a point which keeps on popping up in the remarks of US President Donald Trump .
Reducing imports from India is not an option , Ross was quoted as saying by Prabhu .
" The Commerce Secretary clearly said that trade deficit is an issue , but not by reducing imports from India but promoting more exports from the US to India which is absolutely a very positive and an extremely forward - looking idea , which we welcome , " Prabhu told reporters at the conclusion of his two - day visit to Washington DC .
In the next few years ' time , India would actually be able to buy more from the US .
India has started buying crude oil from the US , he said , adding that there is great potential for the United States in the fast expanding aviation market in India .
Indian aviation companies such as Spicejet and Jet Airways have placed orders for over 300 aircraft worth several billions of dollars .
As American companies shift their manufacturing base from China to the US , this would also result in more American export to India , Prabhu said .
He said that the two countries have agreed to work on the issue of poultry , pork and intellectual property right .
" We already have made some substantial progress , " he said .
Acknowledging that there is a very strong issue on medical devices , Prabhu said he explained to his American counterpart that public health is a priority issue for the Indian government .
" This is something we would have to balance between the commercial interest and the larger public interest , " he said , adding that there is a review due early next year , during which concerns of the US would be relayed back to the reviewers .
Prabhu said that his meetings have yielded very positive results in removal of barriers in export of Indian mangoes to the US .
While the US market was opened up for Indian mangoes during the tenure of former president George W Bush , in reality it has been tough because of the tough irradiation procedure adopted by the US , which not only makes its very expensive , but is also time consuming .
India has been demanding that pre - clearance be transferred to Indian National Plant Protection Organisation , which is well equipped and trained to do the necessary inspection and meet the US standards .
" Of course , you should get Pomegranates and Table Grapes also , " Prabhu said , referring to the progress made in removing hurdles towards export of these products to the US .
Prabhu said , India has sought cooperation from the US on certain technology sectors like artificial intelligence , electric vehicles and aviation .
While acknowledging significant areas of progress in the commercial relationship , Prabhu and Ross shared candid feedback on a range of market access issues that can be addressed to expand trade and investment opportunities .
Ross highlighted the potential to enhance trade by lowering tariff and non - tariff barriers and committing to the use of international standards .
While recognising the reforms that India has undertaken to simplify tax and bankruptcy procedures for industry , he indicated that greater effort in this direction would ensure a more meaningful and balanced trade relationship .
Prabhu appreciated the growing strategic and economic relationship between India and the US .
Emphasising the liberalisation measures undertaken in India , he reaffirmed his government's commitment to make India a favoured investment destination .
While responding to US concerns on price controls on medical devices , Prabhu mentioned about the need to bring about a balance between providing optimum medical facilities and affordable health care to its citizens .
India desires to address the concerns of providing healthcare to its citizens at reasonable costs and balancing it with the need to introduce high - end technology , he said as he encouraged American companies and manufacturers of medical devices to establish manufacturing facilities in India .
He also pointed out that the Draft Pharmaceutical Policy addresses many of the US concerns and sought comments from industry stakeholders on the draft policy .

135 Gurgaon schools fail to submit self - certificates on safety
Gurgaon , Oct 28 ( PTI ) .
More than 130 schools in Gurgaon have failed to submit self - certificates pertaining to the security and safety on their campuses and transport services , an official has said .
The city police will register FIRs against 135 schools for failing to submit the certificates .
The directions were issued by the district education department , Gurgaon Deputy Commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh said yesterday .
The Gurgaon administration and the department had issued several guidelines to schools on safety and security following the killing of a seven - year - old boy in Ryan International School in Bhondsi here on September 8 .
" On the basis of these guidelines , we had asked all private schools to submit the self certification before the district education department within 15 days .
" So far , the department has received certificates from 223 schools , while the remaining 135 schools including a branch of the Ryan International School , have not submitted the same , " Singh said .
The DC said as the order was issued under the CrPC section 144 , the 135 schools , which have not fulfilled the safety guidelines are liable to face action .
The district education department has written a letter to Gurgaon Police Commissioner , Sandeep Khairwar , to register separate FIRs against these schools under relevant IPC sections , he said .
The schools were directed to install CCTV cameras , built separate toilets for non - teaching staffs , deploy women attendants at toilets for primary students , and also install CCTV and GPS school buses among others .
" The 223 schools which have submitted safety compliance certificates will undergo random checking by the district education department , The department will be entitled to take actions against those flouting the safety guidelines , " Singh added .
BJP govt diverting Karad - Chiplun rail line funds to bullet train , alleges Chavan
Mumbai , Oct 28 ( PTI ) .
Former Maharashtra Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan today alleged that the state government is in the process of diverting the funds of the proposed Karad Chiplun railway line project to the Mumbai - Ahmedabad bullet train project .
" Shapoorji Pallonji Co Pvt Ltd , which had inked a memorandum of understanding with Konkan Railway Corporation Limited in August 2016 , has now withdrawn from the ( Karad - Chiplun railway line ) project .
The company was supposed to construct the new train line between Karad and Chiplun at a cost of Rs 3,195 crore , " Chavan said .
" No decision was taken since the MoU was signed and the company had to wait for almost a year .
Now , it has pulled out .
I suspect it is being done to divert the funds for bullet train , " the senior Congress leader alleged .
In order to realise Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ambitious Rs 1,10,000 - crore bullet train project , a loan of Rs 88,000 crore will be taken from Japan .
The funds will be given at a very low rate of interest of 0.1 pe cent per annum by Japan International Cooperation Agency ( JICA ) .
This loan has to be repaid to Japan in 50 years , with 15 years grace period .
Chavan , however , said that land acquisition costs are not considered in these figures .
" The state government will have to spend for it ( land acquisition ) from its treasury .
Hence , the land acquisition costs in the Karad - Chiplun railway line project are going to be diverted to the bullet train project , " Chavan , who represents Karad South assembly constituency , alleged .
" Even if the interest rate is just 0.1 per cent , I think we will have to repay it in the Japanese currency - yen and the appreciation rate of yen is three per cent every year .
In the last decade , the Japanese yen has appreciated over 60 per cent .
So imagine , how much we will have to repay to the Japanese partner after 15 years , " he added .
He also raised question marks over the sharing of expenses for the bullet train project .
" When only 24 per cent length of the bullet train route passes through Maharashtra , why should we bear equal share with Gujarat ?
It means we are paying more by cancelling the already - sanctioned projects in the state , " he said .
The Congress veteran said , the bullet train project was announced just ahead of the Gujarat elections , although its signing of MoU had taken place much earlier .
" On the other hand , metro projects for Pune and Nagpur were signed at the same time , but ( Union minister ) Nitin Gadkari , after swearing - in immediately brought PM Narendra Modi to Nagpur and laid the foundation of the work .
Today , it has significantly progressed , " he said .
Chavan also slammmed the BJP - led state government over its decision to implement 30 per cent cuts on development works across the ministries .
Though the government is saying it is 30 per cent , in reality it will be 50 per cent as this government has miserably failed on managing its finances , he said .
" This government has made several false and tall claims of improving the financial condition of the state .
When the BJP - led dispensation came to power , the total loan on the state government was Rs two lakh crore , which has jumped to Rs four lakh crore .
Who is misleading the people of the state , " Chavan asked .

NKorea nuclear weapon use would meet ' massive military response ' : Mattis
Seoul , Oct 28 ( AFP ) .
US Secretary of Defence Jim Mattis warned today that North Korea would face a " massive military response " if Pyongyang ever used its nuclear weapons .
" Make no mistake - - any attack on the United States or our allies will be defeated , " he said at a press conference on his trip to Seoul .
" Any use of nuclear weapons by the North will be met with a massive military response , effective and overwhelming . "
Tensions have been running high on the Korean peninsula , with the North conducting its sixth nuclear test last month and test - launching multiple missiles capable of reaching the US mainland .
The North's ruler Kim Jong - Un and US President Donald Trump have also traded verbal threats of war and personal insults that have sparked global alarm .
Mattis maintained that diplomacy remained a " preferred course of action " to solve the current crisis but stressed , " our diplomats are most effective when backed by credible military force " .
He urged Pyongyang to " harbour no illusion " , saying the isolated state is militarily " overmatched " by the US and South Korea - - a key ally of Washington that hosts 28,500 US troops .
Trump's recent remark that " only one thing will work " with the North fuelled concerns of a potential conflict on the divided peninsula where the 1950 - 53 Korean War had left millions dead .
But even some Trump advisers say US military options are limited when Pyongyang could launch an artillery barrage on the South's capital Seoul - - only about 50 kms from the border and home to 10 million people .

" This was an extremely friendly , very wide - ranging dialogue on how we can partner together on the strategic relationship that we think is going to define the rest of the 21st century , " Wells said .
While there was a bilateral component to the visit , but they talked about how the two countries with shared values ?
a respect for democracy , transparency , freedom of navigation , for economic development ?
can inculcate these values in the broader Indo - Pacific region , working with important partners like Japan and Australia .
" Tillerson's visit to Gandhi Smriti was very moving , and again , really was a touchstone for what unites ?
that this relationship is very much one built on values , " she said adding that the Secretary of State laid out a lot of ambitions for the relationship .
" We want to build on the June visit by Prime Minister Narendra Modi with the President , and just say , How do we take this relationship to the next level ? , " she said .
" Obviously , we'd like to deepen the military - to - military cooperation that has moved very quickly ; over the last decade we've gone from zero in defence sales to 15 billion in defence sales , " Wells said .
" There are important defence agreements that the two countries can move forward on that will make it easier for the US to share classified data and that will facilitate sales like the F - 16 or the F - 18 and will help create a defence technology partnership , which is what India is seeking , but which will also create jobs for Americans at home , " she said .
" We'd like to expand the bilateral trade and investment dimension of the relationship .
We have about UD 115 billion in trade , USD 40 billion in bilateral investment , " she said noting that this week they have two important meetings going on , the Trade Policy Forum and the Commercial Dialogue .
US sees this as a two - way street .

" During his India visit , Tillerson focused on how they can promote regional stability .
In the South Asia strategy , we've given an important role to India on helping to stabilise Afghanistan economically and to build its human resource capacity , " Wells said .
" Since 2001 , India has invested USD 2 billion in Afghanistan .
They've pledged another USD 1 billion by 2020 .
India has projects in 31 provinces and all of these projects have been very well received .
They're constructive , and I think it's demonstrated that India is an important and valuable partner , " she said .
" At the same time , of course , we've made it clear to everyone that we would never tolerate anyone ? s soil being used against the other , " she added .
Finally , on the fight against terrorism , building on the joint designation we did of Harakat ul - Mujahidin during Prime Minister Modi's visit , we're looking forward to working with the the Indians on identifying additional designations that we should pursue together , " Wells said .

Sena slams Maha govt over ' hasty ' loan waiver scheme roll - out
Mumbai , Oct 28 ( PTI ) .
The Shiv Sena today hit out at the BJP - led Maharashtra government over " hasty " implementation of the Rs 34,022 crore loan waiver scheme for farmers , alleging it has increased their miseries instead of providing relief .
An editorial in Sena mouthpiece ' Saamana ' said , " The government rushed to seek credit for loan waiver implementation , which has now backfired .
It is a classic example of how haste spoils crucial decisions like this and how common people suffer due to it . "
" The whole exercise of loan waiver implementation has , in fact , increased the miseries of farmers instead of providing relief to them , " the Sena , which is a part of the ruling alliance in Maharashtra , alleged .
The Uddhav Thackeray - led party was often at loggerheads with the BJP and has been vocal in criticising the Modi government .
" Loan waiver has been a life or death situation for farmers , but the ruling government tried to seek credit over it , " the ' Saamana ' editorial said .
Recently , the Maharashtra government released Rs 4,000 crore under the first phase of the Rs 34,022 crore farm loan waiver scheme .
The Sena asked if the state government insisted on online registration of farmers , then how come " technical errors " occurred while finalising the list of beneficiaries .
" It shows poor preparation by the state administration before implementing such a big decision , " it said .
The Sena said the government had claimed that farm loan up to Rs 1.50 lakh will be waived , then how come farmers got certificates of waiving of only Rs 10,000 .
" Is it not a cruel joke on farmers ' plight , " it asked .
Sena also alleged that the departments involved in implementation of the scheme are not accepting their mistakes , which has increased the farmers ' woes .

Make judgements understandable to litigants in language they know : Prez
Kochi , Oct 28 ( PTI ) .
President Ram Nath Kovind today stressed the need to make high court judgements understandable to litigants in a language they know and suggested setting up of a mechanism to issue certified translated copies of verdicts .
The President also advocated for speedy disposal of cases as " the poorest and most underprivileged " in the society were the sufferers of delayed justice .
" Delay in delivery of justice is a pressing concern in our country .
Often those who suffer are among the poorest and most underprivileged in our society .
We must find mechanisms to ensure quick disposal of cases , " he said while addressing the valedictory function of the diamond jubilee celebrations of the High Court of Kerala here .
" We could all consider an approach that makes adjournments the exception in an emergency situation rather than a tactic to prolong court proceedings .
We must find a way forward , " the President said at the function also attended by several judges including Chief Justice of India Justice Dipak Misra and Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad .
Kovind said it was important to not only take justice to the people , but also to make it understandable to litigating parties in a language they knew .
" High Courts deliver judgements in English , but we are a country of diverse languages .
The litigant may not be conversant with English and the finer points of the judgement may escape him or her .
The litigating parties will thus be dependent on the lawyer or another person to translate the judgement .
This can add to time and cost , " he said .
The President suggested that a system could be evolved whereby certified translated copies of judgements were made available by the high courts in local or regional languages .
" This could happen in a period of say 24 or 36 hours after the judgement is pronounced .
The language could be Malayalam in the Honourable Kerala High Court or Hindi in the Honourable Patna High Court , as the case may be , " Kovind said adding he was only making a suggestion in this regard .
" It is for the judiciary and the legal fraternity to discuss this and decide as appropriate , " he said .
The President also said the judiciary and justice delivery mechanism of the country would need to continue to keep up with technology and with changes in the society , as indeed they have been so capably doing .

Congress turned Himachal into land of criminals : Adityanath
Shimla , Oct 30 ( PTI ) .
Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has slammed the Virbhadra government in Himachal Pradesh , accusing it of turning " dev bhoomi " into " apraadh bhoomi " .
Canvassing for BJP candidates at Arki and Haroli yesterday , he charged that only crime and corruption has increased under Congress rule in Himachal and urged the people of Himachal Pradesh to vote for the BJP .
" The Congress has turned the " dev bhoomi " ( land of Gods ) into " apraadh bhoomi " ( land of crime ) .
It has sullied the name of the state , which is now known for wine forests and mining mafia , and illegal activities , " he charged .
The drug mafia is in its prime in the state but the government has been keeping mum , Adityanath charged .
People showed the door to the Congress in Uttar Pradesh , Uttarakhand and several other states and now it is the turn of Himachal Pradesh , he said .

India country of Hindus first , others later : Sena
Mumbai , Oct 30 ( PTI ) .
Holding that India is a country of Hindus first and others later , the Shiv Sena today said despite a " pro - Hindutva " government at the Centre , issues like Ram Temple construction in Ayodhya and ' ghar wapsi ' of displaced Kashmiri Pandits are still unresolved .
RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat had on Friday said in Indore that ' Hindustan ' is a country of Hindus , but it does not mean that it does not belong to " others " .
" The RSS chief says like Hindus , India belongs to others as well .
The Shiv Sena chief says India belongs to Hindus first and others later , because there are more than 50 countries for Muslims , " the Sena said in an editorial in party mouthpiece ' Saamana ' .
" Christians have countries like America and ( in ) Europe .
Buddhists have China , Japan , Sri Lanka and Myanmar .
Hindus do not have any country except this .
" Today there is a pro - Hindutva majority government in power .
Yet , it is not willing to build a Ram temple in Ayodhya and left its future in the hands of court , " it said .
" Despite a pro - Hindutva government , the ghar wapsi of Kashmiri Pandits hasn't taken place , " said the Sena , which is a constituent of the NDA government at the Centre and an ally of the ruling BJP in Maharashtra .
It also waded into the ongoing debate over playing the national anthem in public places .
A stubborn attitude prevails towards singing of ' Vande Mataram ' despite the president and the prime minister belonging to the " thought process of the RSS " , and some also do not find it appropriate to stand up while the national anthem is being played , the saffron ally said .
" If these ' others ' are insulting the national anthem by not standing up , the RSS chief should guide the pro - Hindutva government on what stand it should take against them , " it said .
The Sena further said Bhagwat's statement that " no one leader or party can make the country great . . . " also cannot be ignored .
The RSS chief had last week said that no one leader or party can make the country great but it needs a change and we will have to prepare the society for it .

Bumrah , Kumar are world's best death bowlers : Rohit
Kanpur , Oct 30 ( PTI ) .
Senior India batsman Rohit Sharma feels pacers Jasprit Bumrah and Bhuvneshwar Kumar are the world's best death bowlers and the duo have contributed significantly to the recent limited overs success of the team .
While Kumar proved expensive in the series decider against New Zealand , Bumrah bowled brilliantly in the death overs to stop the visitors at 331 for seven in response to India's 337 for six .
New Zealand , needing 30 off the last 18 balls with five wickets in hand , were on course for a famous series win before Bumrah dashed their hopes with a match - winning spell last night .
Rohit , who smashed 147 and stitched a record breaking 230 - run stand with captain Virat Kohli at Green Park , said India could not have won seven bilateral ODI series in a row without Kumar and Bumrah .
" I think we have the two best death bowlers .
If you look at the last series against Australia , the way they have bowled , you have to praise them a lot .
Because if you look at Australia's batting , with their power hitting , those were the two bowlers who got us back most of the times , " said Rohit after India sealed the series 2 - 1 .
" Even in this match there was so much dew , the ball was wet to be able to defend on that kind of wicket , with two set batsmen .
We are talking about two best death bowlers in world currently .
On this wicket , in these conditions , 35 required in four overs , it should have been made easily .
It's only because of these two that we could pull the game back . "
In the previous series against Australia , their captain Steve Smith too had rated Bumrah and Kumar among the best in the business .
India outplayed Australia 4 - 1 but were stretched to the limit by a spirited New Zealand , who eventually failed to win the big moments despite competing hard .
Asked to compare the team's performance in the series , Rohit said both the contests were equally tough .
" Firstly there are no easy wins .
Yes , even when we played against Australia , they tested us a number of times and we responded well to the situations and won the games , " Rohit said .
" Against New Zealand , the first game in Mumbai I thought we did not put enough runs on the board .
280 on a Wankhede wicket was never going to be easy to defend .
But again the last two games we played we showed a lot of character , we came back from tough situations .
That is the hallmark of this team , " he added .
The 30 - year - old right handed batsman said his side's bowlers have delivered under pressure many times in the recent past .
" We knew that it was not going to be that easy because there was a lot of dew on the field .
But our bowlers did exceptionally well to come back every now and then .
Whenever they are put under pressure , they know how to come back .
" It's not happened once , it has happened many times now .
It's a good thing for the team going forward .
If you can respond to these situations really well and handle that situation really well , as a team you are only going to grow , " he said .
Like Bumrah , Rohit too rose to the occasion in a must win match after failing in the previous two matches .
Rohit struck his 15th ODI hundred , his second in as many ODIs at this venue after the 150 he made against South Africa two years ago .
Rohit was satisfied with his effort .
" I started off I started off very cautiously because I understand the threat of Time Southee and Trent Boult with the new ball .
And once the shine of the ball was gone , it was about me not making mistakes and getting out .
" I have played here a few times now and I understand the nature of the wicket .
So unless you make a mistake , you are not going to get out .
And the most important thing about my batting was the partnership .
Because once you get stuck in the partnership , it's always difficult ( for the bowlers ) , " said Rohit .
He revealed that he consulted assistant coach Sanjay Bangar after the failure in Mumbai and Pune .
" I did not make any mental change .
There will be failures at times .
It does not mean you need to change a whole lot .
You need to focus on little things .
I was trying to do that .
Watching my videos , talking to our batting coaches , " Rohit said .
" I like to follow my routine , which is to just understand the nature of the wicket and what shots you need to play . "
PPF closes , NSC gets encashed if holder status changes to NRI
New Delhi , Oct 30 ( PTI ) .
With changes in investment rules for select small savings schemes including National Savings Certificate ( NSC ) , the government has said such accounts will be closed before their maturity in case status of the holder changes from resident to non - resident Indians ( NRIs ) .
Such holders will earn only post office savings account rate of 4 per cent and not the higher rate on those instruments when the status was one of resident .
In the case of public provident fund ( PPF ) , the account is deemed to be closed the day the status of the account holder changes to NRI .
According to the amendment to the Public Provident Fund Act , 1968 , " . . . if a resident who opened an account under this scheme subsequently becomes a non - resident during the currency of the maturity period , the account shall be deemed to be closed with effect from the day he becomes a non - resident . . . "
Interest with effect from that date will be paid at the 4 per cent rate applicable to the post office savings account up to the last day of the month preceding the one in which the account is actually closed , the Public Provident Fund ( Amendment ) Scheme , 2017 , said .
The amended rules were notified in the official gazette earlier this month .
With regard to NSC , a separate notification said it is deemed to be encashed on the day the holder becomes an NRI .
" . . . interest shall be paid at the rate applicable to the post office savings account , from time to time , from such day and up to the last day of the month preceding the month in which it is actually encashed , " it stated .
Last month , the government kept unchanged interest rates on small savings schemes for the October - December quarter .
Since April last year , interest rates on all small saving schemes have been recalibrated on a quarterly basis .
The government has pegged 7.8 per cent interest for both PPF and NSC schemes for October - December .

Indian - Americans celebrate Chhath Pooja in US
Washington , Oct 30 ( PTI ) .
Hundreds of Indian - Americans gathered on the banks of the historic Potomac River in the suburbs here to perform Chhath Pooja with several women attired in colorful saree worshipping the Sun God .
Chhath Pooja entails worship of the Sun God , embodied in cosmic energy , and is observed mainly by people from Bihar and eastern Uttar Pradesh .
The Chhath celebration expanded this year as Indian - Americans in New Jersey for the first time gathered on a lakeside in Monroe township to perform the pooja .
Hundreds of Indian - Americans from in and around Maryland and Virginia area gathered on the banks of the Potomac river as nearly a dozen fasting women entered the river water on Thursday evening and early morning on Friday to worship the Sun God .
" From just me and my family members and a few friends , this has now become a big community event , " said Anita Singh , who has been organising the event for the past ten years now .
Started by the Singh couple ?
Kripa and Anita - - Chhath Pooja celebrations on the banks of the Potomac river attracted people from New Jersey , Pennsylvania , Delaware and Atlanta in addition to the Greater Washington area of Maryland and Virginia .
The Singh family have been doing this for a decade now at the same place on the river bank , which in addition to hundreds of Indian - Americans have also started attracting several curious onlookers .
An individual initiative so far , the Chhath celebrations this year attracted dozens of volunteers from near and far who helped the Singh family in every aspect of the festival from elaborate rituals , to the big community event on the river bank .
They volunteered to provide free snacks to the visitors on Friday morning .
Given the large turnout of the community members in the few years , Kripa Singh said they have now started looking for a parcel of land on the bank of Potomac river which can be developed into a traditional " Ghat " ?
steps leading to the river ?
for the annual celebration of the Chhath festival .
Inspired by the Chhath Pooja celebrations on the Potomac river bank , the Bihar Jharkhand Association of North America ( BAJANA ) organised the festival for the first time ever in New Jersey .
Over 300 devotees from all around New Jersey and the tri - state area got together at the lakeside of Thompson Park , Monroe township to offer their prayers to the rising and setting sun .
" Volunteers got together in advance to make prasad for the members attending the pooja .
The cold weather and frozen feet did not stop the devotees from entering the water and offer the ' Arag ' to the Sun God , " said Alok Kumar from BAJANA .
" Everyone was emotional attending the event because they were attending it for decades !
Having the chance to attend it here at home in New Jersey was a dream come true , " Kumar said .
Aadhaar case : SC pulls up Mamata govt , asks how can state challenge Parliament's mandate
New Delhi , Oct 30 ( PTI ) .
The Supreme Court today came down hard on the Mamata Banerjee government for filing a plea challenging the Centre's move to make Aadhaar mandatory for availing benefits of social welfare schemes , saying it was against the federal structure .
The top court asked how a state can challenge the mandate of Parliament and said the West Bengal Chief Minister could file the plea as an individual .
" How can a state file such a plea .
In a federal structure , how can a state file a plea challenging Parliament's mandate , " a bench comprising Justices A K Sikri and Ashok Bhushan said .
Senior advocate Kapil Sibal , appearing for the West Bengal government , told the court that the plea has been filed by the labour department of the state as subsidies under these schemes have to be given by them .
" You satisfy us how the state has challenged it .
We know it is a matter which needs consideration , " the bench said adding the Centre's move can be challenged by an individual but not by states .
" Let Mamata Banerjee come and file a plea as individual .
We will entertain it as she will be an individual , " the top court said .
However , Sibal maintained that the state was entitled to file such a plea but said that they would amend the prayer in the petition .
Meanwhile , the bench issued notice to the Centre on a separate plea filed by an individual challenging the linking of mobile phone numbers with Aadhaar .
The court has asked the Centre to file its response on the plea in four weeks .
The West Bengal government challenged the provision which says that without Aadhaar , the benefits of social welfare schemes would not be extended .
Earlier , the Centre had told the apex court that the deadline for mandatory linking of Aadhaar to avail benefits of various government schemes has been extended till March 31 next year for those who do not have the 12 - digit biometric identification number .
It had said that the deadline extension from December end till March 31 , 2018 , would apply only to those who do not have Aadhaar and are willing to enrol for it .
Several petitions , challenging the Centre's move to make Aadhaar mandatory for welfare schemes and notifications to link it with mobile numbers and bank accounts , are pending in the apex court .
Tents used by veterans for Jantar Mantar OROP protest uprooted
New Delhi , Oct 30 ( PTI ) .
Armed with an NGT order banning protests and dharnas around the historic Jantar Mantar here , the police and civic officials today demolished tents and makeshift structures set up by ex - servicemen protesting there demanding implementation of the One Rank - One Pension scheme .
The former servicemen have been protesting there for the past more than two years and the police said the exercise was carried out after the October 5 order of the National Green Tribunal .
The police also said the protesters were informed about the NGT order in advance and asked either to leave or bring a stay order from the court .
However , the ex - servicemen termed it " an attempt to throttle our voice in a democracy " .
Major General ( Retd ) Satbir Singh , who is among those spearheading the protest at the site , said the police and MCD officials came with a JCB machine and demolished their tents and other temporary structures .
" They also took away our equipment and other stuff like beddings at around 8.45 AM .
We have been protesting peacefully demanding implementation of the OROP scheme , " he said .
" It is an attempt to throttle our voice in a democracy .
And , even if there has been any order from any tribunal , there is a way to do things .
What they have done is completely unfair and unjust , " he added .
Singh further said the wife of an ex - serviceman was inside the tent when the exercise was carried out .
He , however , clarified that nobody was hurt .
The police denied use of any force .
" The OROP protesters were informed about the NGT's order about vacating the Jantar Mantar area and asked to either leave or bring a stay order from the court , " a senior police official said .
The NGT had on October 5 banned all protests and dharnas around the historic Jantar Mantar , which has been a hotspot of many agitations for decades , saying such activities violate environmental laws .
The green panel had also directed the NDMC to remove all temporary structures , loudspeakers and public address systems from the stretch of the road .
The NGT had ordered the NDMC Chairman , the police chief and the Delhi government to file compliance reports within five weeks from October 5 .
The NGTs verdict had come on a plea filed by Varun Seth and others alleging that processions and agitations held by social groups , political parties , NGOs at the Jantar Mantar Road were a major source of noise pollution in the area .

Extra - regional nations maintaining near permanent presence in Indian Ocean : Sitharaman
Panaji , Nov 1 ( PTI ) .
Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman today voiced concern over increased militarisation and extra - regional nations maintaining a near permanent presence in the Indian Ocean region on " some pretext or the other " .
This sort of militarisation increases complexities for the countries in the region , she said .
" The Indian Ocean has been peaceful over past few decades .
However , our collective decision to capitalise on this or not and how we counter the emerging challenges will significantly influence the regional peace and security in future , " she said .
The minister , who did not name any country , was addressing the inaugural function of the Goa Maritime Conclave , which aims to address the maritime challenges in the region .
An increased militarisation in the Indian Ocean has manifested in two interconnected forms in the region , Sitharaman said .
" We have also witnessed extra - regional nations maintain a near permanent presence within the region on one pretext or the other , " she said .
" In order to sustain such a presence through operational turnaround , these countries , which are extra - regional , are creating naval outposts as well as dual use infrastructure in the region .
This sort of militarisation increases the complexities for the countries of this region , " Sitharaman said .
The defence minister also expressed concern over the emergence of non - state actors in the region .
" The concept of non - state actors is not something new as the countries are dealing with this issue both at land and at sea since time immemorial , " she said .
" However , the recent surge in the number of non - state actors , when juxtaposed with the support they enjoy from certain states , their enhanced reach as well as access to the resources has brought the issue to the forefront and demands a firm action , " she said .
Referring to the ' blue economy ' , the Union minister said the ? sea bed has emerged as a futuristic and abundant source of relatively pure minerals , thereby adding to the ocean's economic potential .
" The progress achieved and the efforts to harness clean and renewable energy sources through off shore energy firms add a whole new dimension to the possible economic and strategic impact of the ocean on countries of this region , " Sitharaman said .
While it is good that the compulsion of globalisation has enabled economics to shape relationships between nations , the opaqueness in strategic intent by certain nations is preventing these very relations from evolving beyond a transactional nature , she added .

NOT IN THE U.S.A . ! "

The One World Trade Center , the main building of the rebuilt World Trade Center complex destroyed during the September 11 , 2001 terror attack , was lit in red , white and blue in honour of freedom and democracy .
New York has been largely spared from terrorism since nearly 3,000 people were killed in the 9 / 11 attack .
The most recent violence from terrorism there came in September 2016 , when a man set off shrapnel - packed explosives in the Chelsea neighbourhood of Manhattan .
Nobody was killed , but 30 people were injured .
Trucks have become a common weapon for terrorists in recent years , with the ISIS encouraging its followers to use them in carrying out deadly attacks .
In July 2016 , as thousands of people crammed into the streets of Nice , France , for a Bastille Day celebration , an assailant influenced by the Islamic State drove a 19 - tonne cargo truck into a crowd , leaving 86 dead and 434 injured .
In December , a man with ties to Islamic State drove a 27 - tonne truck into a Christmas market in Berlin , killing 12 people and injuring 56 others .
Three months later , a man drove his car into pedestrians on London ? s Westminster Bridge , killing four and injuring dozens more , before jumping out and fatally stabbing a police officer and being shot dead by other officers .

Artificial breeding - a ray of hope to conserve Mahseer fish
Bhopal , Nov 1 ( PTI ) .
The Madhya Pradesh forest department is hopeful that artificial breeding of ' Mahseer ' fish in the Narmada river will help in conserving the endangered species , an official said today .
Due to continuous fishing , the Mahseer , popularly known as the ' tiger of fresh water ' and having the distinction of being the state fish of MP , is facing the threat of extinction , he said .
The conservation of Mahseer is important as its presence is considered a benchmark for the cleanliness of water in the Narmada river , the official said .
The forest department , in collaboration with the state biodiversity board , has achieved a breakthrough in artificial breeding of Narmada Mahseer ( also popular as ' tor - tor ' among locals ) following efforts over the past couple of years , an official of the public relations department said .
" Repeated attempts in this direction failed for last two - three years .
This year , the experiment was carried out by scientists in the flowing water of Narmada's tributary - the Choral river , " he said .
" For the first time , about 20 per cent of the eggs ( of Mahseer fish ) have fertilised .
This project would be beneficial to the fishermen in a big way , " the official said .
The breeding of around 150 baby fish of Mahseer has been done .
The forest department will further try to increase the number of the species with the help of these baby fish , " he added .

Myanmar's Suu Kyi makes 1st visit to northern Rakhine
Yangon , Nov 2 ( AFP ) .
Myanmar's leader Aung San Suu Kyi arrived on her first visit to conflict - battered northern Rakhine State today , an official said , an unannounced trip to an area that has seen most of its Rohingya Muslim population forced out by an army campaign .
Suu Kyi , a nobel laureate who leads Myanmar's pro - democracy party , has been hammered by the international community for failing to use her moral power to speak up in defence of the Rohinyga .
Some 600,000 of the stateless minority have fled to Bangladesh since late August carrying accounts of murder , rape and arson at the hands of the Myanmar's army , after militant raids sparked a ferocious military crackdown .
The UN says that crackdown is tantamount to ethnic cleansing , while pressure has mounted on Myanmar to provide security for the Rohingya and allow people to return home .
" The State Counsellor ( Suu Kyi's official title ) is now in Sittwe and will go to Maungdaw and Buthiduang too .
It will be a day trip , " government spokesman Zaw Htay told AFP , mentioning two of the epicentres of the violence but without elaborating on her schedule .
It is her first trip in office to northern Rakhine , which has hosted the worst of the communal violence that has cut through the western state since 2012 , severely damaging Myanmar's global reputation .
It was not clear if Suu Kyi would visit some of the hundreds of Rohinyga villages torched by the army - allegedly aided by ethnic Rakhine Buddhist locals - or if she would be taken to see remaining clusters of the Muslim group , who are living in fear and hunger surrounded by hostile neighbours .
Thousands of others are believed to still be camped on a beach near Maungdaw awaiting boats to Bangladesh in increasingly parlous conditions .
The Rohingya are hated in Buddhist - majority Myanmar , where they are denied citizenship and widely dismissed as illegal " Bengali " immigrants .
Observers say Suu Kyi has chosen not to criticise the army in fear of a backlash from a powerful institution that controls all security matters .
The plight of the Rohingya also garners little sympathy inside Myanmar , making any defence of the minority a politically unpopular cause amid surging Buddhist nationalist sentiment .
Suu Kyi heads a committee charged with rebuilding Rakhine and repatriating Rohingya from Bangladesh who meet strict criteria for re - entry to Myanmar .
Yesterday , spokesman Zaw Htay accused Bangladesh of delaying the start of the repatriation process .
Dhaka has yet to send an official list of the Rohingya who have fled since August 25 , he told AFP .
The Rohingya have packed into makeshift camps on a poor , already overcrowded slip of border land inside Bangladesh .
Aid groups say the risk of major outbreaks of disease is high while they struggle to deliver food and basic supplies to the unprecedented number of refugees .

New York attack : Uzbek man charged with terrorism offences
New York , Nov 2 ( PTI ) .
Sayfullo Saipov , an Uzbek immigrant accused of killing eight people in an ISIS - inspired assault on the New York City , was today charged with terrorism offences by US prosecutors who said he decided to carry out the truck attack " to inflict maximum damage against civilians " .
Saipov , 29 , was charged with providing material support to the Islamic State ( ISIS ) militant group and violence and destruction of motor vehicles .
Eight people were killed and 11 others injured as his truck carved a path of destruction through several blocks of Lower Manhattan yesterday .
Saipov crashed the truck into a school bus , left the vehicle brandishing imitation firearms .
He was shot by police .
It was the the worst terrorist attack in on the city since 9 / 11 .
Saipov underwent a surgery in a New York hospital yesterday .
He appeared in federal court today in a wheelchair and did not enter a plea .
A 10 - page complaint was filed by the FBI before a federal court in New York against him .
The FBI said that Saipov , a resident of New Jersey , was inspired by the ISIS to carry out the terrorist attack .
He " requested to display ISIS ? s flag " in his hospital room and stated that he felt good about what he had done , the complaint said .
Saipov told investigators he was inspired by Islamic State videos , in particular one showing ISIS leader Abu Bakr al - Baghdadi , it said .
The suspect decided to conduct a truck attack " to inflict maximum damage against civilians " and that he specifically chose to strike on Halloween " because he believed there would be more civilians on the street for the holiday , " the complaint says .
He began planning an attack a year ago and decided two months ago to use a truck , officials said .
" In particular , Saipov was motivated to commit the attack after viewing a video in which Abu Bakr al - Baghdadi . . . questioned what Muslims in the United States and elsewhere were doing to respond to the killing of Muslims in Iraq , " the complaint said .
During a search operation , federal officials obtained two cell phones from his possession .
One cellphone contained approximately 90 videos , many of which appear to be , ISIS - related propaganda .
The cell phone also contained approximately 3,800 images , many of which appear to be ISIS propaganda .
Internet search history of the second cell phone reflects , among other things , that Saipov searched for a store in Passaic in New jersey on October 4 , searched for Halloween in New York on October 15 , and searched for truck rentals on October 18 , the complaint said .
After Saipov rented the truck from Home Depot , he entered the New York City .
In carrying out the attack , Saipov relied on the playbook laid out by ISIS in recent years , officials said .
" He appears to have followed almost exactly to a ' T ' the instructions that ISIS has put out in its social media channels before , with instructions to their followers on how to carry out such an attack , " John Miller , New York Police Department commissioner for intelligence and counterterrorism , said at an earlier news conference .
A handwritten " document " found near the scene had both Arabic and English text , and included the message that the Islamic State would endure , the complaint said .
In the vicinity of a place where Saipov was shot , he dropped the weapons , which appear to be a paintball gun and pellet gun , and a black bag .
Inside the Bag , law enforcement officers recovered , among other things , three knives and a wallet .

Rameswaram ( TN ) , Nov 2 ( PTI ) Thirteen Tamil Nadu fishermen were arrested by the Sri Lankan Navy when they were allegedly fishing near Neduntheevu in the island nation waters today .
The fishermen from here and Pudukottai district were arrested on charges of poaching fish with banned fishing nets in the exclusive zone of Sri Lanka , Assistant Directors of fisheries department , Manikandan said .

Constitution Bench of SC commences hearing on Delhi - Centre governance row
New Delhi , Nov 2 ( PTI ) .
The Supreme Court today commenced hearing on a batch of pleas filed by the Delhi government against the high court verdict which had held that Delhi is not a state and the Lieutenant Governor ( LG ) is its administrative head .
Senior advocate Gopal Subramaniam , appearing for the Delhi government , initiated the argument before a five - judge Constitution bench headed by Chief Justice Dipak Misra .
He told a bench , also comprising Justices A K Sikri , A M Khanwilkar , D Y Chandrachud and Ashok Bhushan that their plea challenges the Delhi High Court order of August 4 , last year , by which it has said that LG is the administrative head of Delhi , which is also a union territory .
He said the challenge is to Article 239 AA by virtue of which special status is accorded to Delhi .
The apex court had on February 15 referred to a Constitution Bench the pleas filed by the AAP government against the high court verdict which had held that Delhi is not a state and the LG is its administrative head .
The city government had on February 2 told the apex court that it has exclusive executive powers in relation to matters falling within the purview of the Legislative Assembly and neither the Centre nor the President or the LG can encroach upon these .
The apex court , however , had said that it is correct that the elected government should have some powers but whether it will be as per the Delhi High Court verdict or as it is being perceived by the Delhi government needed to be looked into .
The Constitution has given a face and identity to a government in Delhi after inclusion of Article 239AA and the executive decisions taken and implemented by it cannot be reversed by the LG , it had contended .
The apex court had on December 14 , last year , observed that the Delhi government should have some powers otherwise it cannot function while hearing the appeals of the city government .
On September 9 , 2016 , the apex court had refused to grant an interim stay on the verdict of the Delhi High Court of August 4 last year .

Both NDA and UPA ignored tourism sector , says Shashi Tharoor
New Delhi , Nov 2 ( PTI ) .
The former UPA regime has been knocked by one of its own - - MP Shashi Tharoor .
The ex - Union minister believes that his former government and the one led by Narendra Modi have ignored the all - important sector of tourism .
India , the Kerala MP said , was not investing money in building the infrastructure needed to draw tourists .
" I am taken aback by the fact that both my own government and the present one seem oblivious of the fact that there's a whole series of studies that says a thousand dollars invested in tourism will employ eight times as many people as the same amount invested in manufacturing , " Tharoor said on Tuesday at the concluding session of the literary festival Penguin Fever 2017 .
At a panel dicussion on ' The Rise of the Elephant ' where the other speakers included principal economic advisor Sanjeev Sanyal and author Gurcharan Das , Tharoor asserted that investment in the tourism sector would help the elephant - - a metaphor for India - - rise .
" Dubai and Singapore gets more people visiting them in a day than we get in terms of foreign tourists in a year .
Very clearly this has been a missed opportunity for a very long time , " he said .
The Congress MP also wondered what there was to celebrate in the recently out World Bank ' Doing Business 2018 ' report which showed that India's rank on the ' ease of doing business ' index had improved from the 130th position last year to 100th out of a list of 190 countries .
" Modi promised to us that we will be in the first 50 positions within two years of his government and the fact is that after four years we are at number 100 .
" When the prime minister of India announces a target and fails spectacularly . . . it's worth pointing that out before we start celebrating too much on this , " he noted .

No fin assistance by govt to bonded labourers : PIL in HC
New Delhi , Nov 3 ( PTI ) .
The Delhi government is not providing financial assistance to people rescued from bondage , a victim of bonded labour today said in a PIL in the Delhi High Court .
Taking note of the seriousness of the issue , a bench of Acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice C Hari Shankar issued notice to the Centre and Delhi government and sought their stand on the plea by a Jharkhand man , who was working as a bonded labour in a shop here from where he was rescued .
The court also made the Delhi State Legal Services Authority ( DSLSA ) a party in the matter and sought its response too before the next date of hearing on December 11 .
The petitioner has claimed that he was rescued in February this year in a raid carried out under the supervision of the Sub Divisional Magistrate ( SDM ) of the south east district of Delhi .
However , till date he has not been given any financial assistance as provided under the Central Sector Scheme for Rehabilitation of Bonded Labour 2016 , despite several letters to the SDM and District Magistrate ( DM ) of the south east district of Delhi , the petition has claimed .
Under the scheme , an immediate financial assistance of Rs 5,000 was to be provided by the DM .
This amount was later enhanced to Rs 20,000 , the plea said .
The petitioner , Walter Kerketta , has also alleged that besides him , there were several minors who were rescued from bonded labour , but were yet to received any financial aid from the Delhi government .
He has also claimed that the Delhi government has not ensured that the district authorities have a permanent corpus fund of Rs 10 lakh , as mandated under the scheme , for immediate rehabilitation and assistance of victims of bonded labour .

No workmen directors in nationalised banks : plea in HC
New Delhi , Nov 3 ( PTI ) .
There are no workmen or non - workmen directors in any of the nationalised banks in the country , a plea today claimed in the Delhi High Court which asked the government to respond .
Justice Vibhu Bakhru issued notice to the Centre and sought its stand on the grievance raised in the petition by the All India Bank Officers Confederation .
The petition , filed through advocate Prashant Bhushan , has claimed that the Banking Companies ( Acquisition and transfer of Undertakings ) Act empowers the central government to make a scheme to include representation from workmen or non - workmen employees on the Board of Directors of nationalised banks .
Advocate Shakti Vardhan Sharma , appearing for the petitioner organisation , told the court that under the Nationalised Banks ?
( Management and Miscellaneous Provisions ) Scheme , 1970 , a workman or non - workman employee director has to be nominated by the government from a panel of three such persons furnished to it by their representative union .
The organisation has contended that the intention behind workmen or non - workmen employee directors is to provide representation to every class of employees on the nationalised banks ' boards of directors .
" But it is being noticed that currently all the banks do not have any workmen / non - workmen employee director on their Board .
Punjab and Sind Bank has had no non - workmen employee director since 2008 .
Most of the workmen and non - workmen employee director posts are vacant since 2016 .
" The whole purpose of giving representation to these class of employees is defeated if the central government fails to appoint directors on time , " the petition has said .
It has alleged that despite the unions forwarding the names of potential candidates to the government , no appointments have been made .
The petitioner organisation has sought directions to the Centre to appoint workmen and non - workmen employee directors on the boards of all nationalised banks .
workmen directors in any of the nationalised banks in the country , a plea today claimed in the Delhi High Court which asked the government to respond .

It listed the petition on November 15 when a similar matter comes up for hearing in which the high court had earlier set up a committee to look into the menace of unauthorised construction in all corners of Delhi .

The chairman of selection committee has not spoken to me about this .
You have asked me this question , and I can only tell you about my interaction with the team management .
" When I reached Ranchi , I told Virat about my plan , and his first reaction was , ' Are you sure ?
You can still play IPL .
You can play as coach - cum - player . '
I said no .
I am retiring completely . "

I have not spoken to any selector over this issue . "

When I am leaving , I am not leaving with their permission . "

I didn't come to just look around , " Nehra told reporters .

Cash comes at a cost , nation moving towards digital economy:FM
New Delhi , Nov 6 ( PTI ) .
Ahead of the first anniversary of demonetisation , Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said today that excessive cash in the economy has " its own cost " and India is gradually moving towards digital transactions .
Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced on November 8 last year the scrapping of old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes as part of the government's efforts to fight black money and corruption .
Following that , the Centre has been pushing for digital payments and transactions through the banking channel so as to promote a ' less - cash ' economy .
However , the opposition parties have criticised demonetisation and plan to observe November 8 as " black day " across the country .
Jaitley said some people have problem in accepting the fact that transactions through the digital mode and banking instruments are going to witness a rapid growth as compared to cash dealings .
At the inauguration of the new building of Punjab National Bank ( PNB ) head office here , Jaitley said : " Excessive dependence on cash has its own cost .
" It is not just cost but there is a curse of cash .
It has impact on both society and economy . "
He said there is a clear change taking place as to how India and Indians are spending money and the change is only in one direction .
It will not happen abruptly but the movement towards a less - cash economy is very clear , he said , adding that it will lead to more deposits with banks , increasing their lending ability at affordable rates .
Banking is the life line of the economy and it will gain further importance in the coming days , he said .
A healthy banking system will help support growth of the economy , he added .
Jaitley also launched two products of the PNB - - Rupay Credit Card and e - Rupaya .
Minister of State for Finance Shiv Pratap Shukla asked banks to focus on rural India and work towards improving customer experience .
He also said that managements of banks should focus on welfare of their employees .

Gomes had resigned as Inspector General of Prisons to join AAP and led its campaign in Goa .
" In fact a lot of people thought that Elvis is my strong officer .
When he went to a political set up , lot of people asked me whether I have planted my man there , " Parrikar said .
" That was the reaction . . .
He ( Gomes ) also must have heard people saying it , because people in Goa don't think that political thinking can be different from other things , " the chief minister said .
Parrikar was ? addressing the event to launch Vedanta's Women's Football League .
Gomes who is also president of Goa Football Association was present on the dais along with the chief minister .
Parrikar said he does not mix politics and development or football .
" Whether it is development , game or state as a whole , for me every person is equal and I don't treat them as an adversary , " he said .
Referring to Gomes , he said " political differences will be there .
Once election code of conduct is announced , we won't see each other .
But after that we can work together . "
Talking about Indian football , Parrikar said the sport requires lot of more energy so that it crosses a threshold .
He said Goa also requires the push in football .
" In spite of all our efforts we can't find many of them representing the country .
Lot of facilities need to be opened up but the only problem is that there has to be some discipline , " he commented .

New Delhi , Nov 6 ( PTI ) .
The Supreme Court today said it would hear next week a plea challenging the Department of Telecommunication ( DOT's ) notification on mandatory linking of mobile numbers with Aadhaar .

Trump promises to ' figure it out ' with S Korea's Moon
Seoul , Nov 7 ( AFP ) .
US President Donald Trump arrived in Seoul today vowing to " figure it all out " with his South Korean counterpart Moon Jae - In , despite the two allies ' differences on how to deal with the nuclear - armed North .
As tensions over Pyongyang's weapons programme have soared , the US president has traded personal insults and threats of war with North Korean leader Kim Jong - Un , but the South's capital and its 10 million inhabitants would be on the front line of any conflict .
" Getting ready to leave for South Korea and meetings with President Moon , a fine gentleman , " Trump tweeted early today from Japan , the first stop on his Asian tour , adding : " We will figure it all out ! "
The tone was in marked contrast to a previous Trump tweet in which he accused Moon - who has backed engagement with the North to bring it to the negotiating table - of " appeasement " .
Trump walked down the steps of Air Force One at Osan air base outside Seoul accompanied by the First Lady , and was welcomed by South Korean foreign minister Kang Kyung - Wha .
The US president flew in from Japan after securing Tokyo's full support for Washington's stance that " all options are on the table " regarding Pyongyang , and declaring its nuclear ambitions " a threat to the civilised world and international peace and stability " .
He enjoyed three days of near - bromance with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe , calling him " wonderful " after a round of golf and describing US - Japan ties as " really extraordinary " .
Trump's relationship with Moon , a former human rights lawyer , is noticeably cooler , stoking concerns about the decades - old alliance and fears in Seoul that it could be sidelined by the US in favour of Tokyo .
South Korea is rolling out the red carpet for Trump as it seeks messages of assurance about the alliance and US resolve .
At the same time , while Trump has threatened Pyongyang with " fire and fury " , Moon is mindful that much of Seoul is within range of the North's artillery and in an address to parliament last week demanded : " There should be no military action on the peninsula without our prior consent . "
In an editorial today ahead of Trump's arrival , the Korea Times said of the US president : " His ' rhetorical bombs ' say it all . "
" However calm Koreans are reported to be about the Trump - Kim war of words , we cherish our lives as much as Americans do theirs and feel scared by the outlook of war , " it added .
Kim Hyun - Wook , a professor at the Korea National Diplomatic Academy , told AFP that the two allies have " subtle differences in their positions " and underlying suspicions about each other .
Citizens views are mixed , with both " No Trump " and " Welcome President Trump " demonstrations taking place in downtown Seoul since the weekend , sometimes only a few blocks apart .
North Korea - which carried out by far its most powerful nuclear test to date in September - itself welcomed Trump to the region with a rhetorical volley via the ruling party newspaper Rodong Sinmun , warning a " spiritually instable " president against making " reckless remarks " .
Another issue will be trade between the two nations , with Trump expected to bring up the renegotiation of the five - year - old US - Korea free trade agreement which he has called a " horrible deal " and a " job killer " .
His first stop in the South will be Camp Humphreys , where US forces stationed in the country have moved their headquarters from downtown Seoul .
Later he will have a summit with Moon at the Blue House , followed by a lavish dinner with live concerts by both Korean traditional musicians and K - pop artists .
Tomorrow , Trump will speak to South Korean MPs but his visit will not include a trip to the Demilitarised Zone dividing the Korean peninsula , with the administration downplaying the destination as " a little bit of a cliche " .
Some observers have fretted that a gaffe by a president given to off - the - cuff remarks could send tensions rising on the peninsula .
" If Trump says anything that can provoke North Korea , it could send military tensions soaring again , " said professor Koo Kab - Woo from the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul .

BJD regime responsible for farmer suicides in Odisha : Pradhan
Bhubaneswar , Nov 6 ( PTI ) .
Union Minister Dharmendra Pradhan today held the BJD regime responsible for farmer suicides in Odisha due to crop loss caused by pest attack and claimed it used the tragedy to announce relief package , instead of taking timely steps to prevent such incidents .
Pradhan alleged that the " insensitive " state government waited for a situation to announce the package , keeping an eye on the upcoming by - election for Bijepur Assembly seat .
" The BJD government in Odisha is not only inefficient , corrupt and insensitive , but is also responsible for suicide by farmers hit by crop loss due to pest attack , " the Petroleum Minister said at a press meet here .
Dubbing the BJD regime as " anti - farmer " , the BJP leader said though the state government had announced Rs 100 would be given as bonus to the farmers over and above the minimum support price ( MSP ) for paddy , it is yet to become a reality .
The Union Minister said several BJP - ruled states including Chhattisgarh are providing such bonus , while in Odisha , it remained only an announcement without being translated into action .
Pradhan lashed out at the state government for having failed to bring out a new share - cropper policy , despite making an announcement in this regard long back .
The minister said he has spoken to Union Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh regarding the situation in Odisha for appropriate steps .
Pradhan also criticised Odisha's Agriculture Minister Damodar Rout for stating that no compensation would be given to farmers , who have burnt their pest - infected crops .

Air pollution hits ' severe ' levels in Delhi
New Delhi , Nov 7 ( PTI ) .
Delhi woke up to ' severe ' air quality today under a blanket of thick haze , as pollution levels breached the permissible standards by multiple times .
The rapid fall in air quality and visibility began last evening itself as moisture combined with pollutants shrouded the city in a thick cover of haze .
By 10 am today , the Central Pollution Control Board ( CPCB ) recorded ' severe ' air quality , meaning the intensity of pollution was extreme .
In light of the sudden dip , measures under the Graded Response Action Plan ( GRAP ) such as a four times hike in parking fees may be rolled out by the Supreme Court - mandated Environment Pollution Prevention and Control Authority .
If the situation deteriorates further and persists for at least 48 hours , the task force under the GRAP will mull shutting schools and enforcing the odd - even car rationing scheme .
The last time air had turned ' severe ' was on October 20 , a day after Diwali festivities , when firecrackers were set off .
Since then , the pollution monitors have been recording ' very poor ' air quality , which is comparatively better than ' severe ' but alarming according to global standards .
A ' very poor ' AQI comes with the warning that people may develop respiratory illness on prolonged exposure while exposure to ' severe ' air affects healthy people and seriously impacts those with existing respiratory or cardiovascular diseases .
The CPCB has said high moisture level in the air has trapped emission from local sources and hanging low over the city in the absence of wind .
" Total calm conditions , marked by the complete absence of wind has led to the situation .
The moisture has trapped emissions from ground level sources , " Dipankar Saha , CPCB's air lab chief , said .
According to private weather forecasting agency Skymet , wind from neighbouring Punjab and Haryana , where paddy stubble burning is in full swing , has started entering the city during the afternoon hours .
The CPCB also recorded ' severe ' air quality in the neighbouring Noida and Ghaziabad .
The real - time pollution monitors displayed alarmingly high concentration of PM2.5 and PM10 , which are ultrafine particulates having the ability to enter the respiratory system and subsequently the bloodstream of humans and animals , causing harm .

Kota ( Raj ) , Nov 6 ( PTI ) .
Health service in four districts of Rajasthan was affected as around 640 government doctors in Kota , Bundi , Baran and Jhalawar districts went on strike today over their various demands .

Health department officials said that 31 doctors from Kota medical college have been sent to hospitals in Baran , Bundi and Rampura , while AYUSH doctors are providing healthcare services to the patients at community and primary health centres .
Around 250 doctors , including 43 from Baran district headquarters have gone on strike , CMHO Baran Brajesh Goyal said .
Meanwhile , General Secretary of All Rajasthan In Service Doctors Association Dr Durga Shankar Saini said they were forced to go on strike as the state government did not pay heed to their 33 - point demand .
These demands are not in the interest of the doctors but for improvement of medical and healthcare facilities that would eventually be beneficial for the patients , Dr Saini claimed .
Representatives of the association have held nine rounds of talks with the state government so far , but of no avail .
The doctors are ready to call off the strike if the state government gives a written assurance that their demands would be met , he said .

Texas church shooting not racially motivated : Authorities
Houston , Nov 7 ( PTI ) .
The gunman who killed 26 people at a church in the US state of Texas had a history of domestic violence and sent threatening text messages to his mother - in - law , according to authorities which said the shooting was not racially or religiously motivated .
The gunman , identified as 26 - year - old Devin Patrick Kelley , wearing black tactical - style gear walked into the church and started firing from an assault rifle just after the Sunday morning service began at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs .
Texas law enforcement officials said that the shooting was not racially or religiously motivated , rather it was connected to a " domestic situation going on within [ his extended ] family , which wouldn't be a first for him " .
" We know that he expressed anger towards his mother - in - law , who attends this church , " Freeman Martin of the Texas Department of Public Safety said , adding that the court - martialled former US Air Force airman had a history of sending her threatening texts .
But his mother - in - law was not inside the church when Kelley sprayed bullets on worshippers .
However , the gunman's grandmother - in - law was present at the church when Kelley stormed in from the backdoor , firing all the way to the front and firing on his way back out of the church , authorities said .
He reloaded several times .
He killed his grandmother - in - law during the attack , friends of the woman told the media .
Authorities , however , also believe that the shooting was not a case in which suspect went to the church looking for his relatives but ended up killing many others .
" He was there to kill everybody .
He is a mass killer of children and people . . . he is a horrible monster , " a source familiar with the matter told ABC News .
The ages of the deceased range from 18 months to 77 years , authorities said .
Eight members of a family , including a pregnant woman and a 17 - month - old girl , were among 26 people killed in the massacre .
The Holcombes lost family members across three generations .
Among the dead were 12 to 14 children .
The church's pastor Frank Pomeroy's 14 - year - old daughter , Annabelle , was also among the dead .
Texas Governor Greg Abbott called the slaughter " the largest mass shooting " in the state's history and ordered flags across the state to fly at half - staff .
Evidence show that the suspect died from a self - inflicted gunshot wound , and multiple weapons were found in the vehicle , authorities said .
Kelley was previously a member of the US Air Force and served at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico from 2010 until his discharge .
He was court - martialled in 2012 for assault on his spouse and their child , according to Stefanek .
He served a year in confinement and received a bad conduct discharge .
His rank was also reduced .
He also ran into trouble with the law as a civilian , according to court records , which indicate he was cited for misdemeanor cruelty to animals in August 2014 .
Recently , he was fired from a brief stint as a water park security guard this summer , his former employer said .
His most recent job was as a night security guard at an RV park in New Braunfels .
The manager said that he started working there six weeks ago , and he left early on Saturday , saying that he had a headache .
He never went to work on Sunday , the day of the shooting .
Kelley also used his cellphone to tell his father that he had been shot and did not think he would survive , authorities said .

Chidambaram says jobs , lives lost due to demonetisation
New Delhi , Nov 8 ( PTI ) .
Launching a scathing attack on the Modi government on the note ban anniversary , senior Congress leader P Chidambaram today said millions of people " suffered " and no one can deny that lives and jobs were lost due to demonetisation .
A year after the demonetisation decision , the former Union finance minister said on this " black day , people should read real - life stories and say a prayer for the " millions who suffered " .
" Can any one deny lives were lost , small businesses closed and jobs were lost ? , " he said in a series of tweets .
Chidambaram claimed cash with the public is Rs 15 lakh crore and it is increasing and will soon reach the November 2016 level of Rs 17 lakh crore .
? He said how much cash ( money supply ) there should be , is a decision of the RBI , not the government .
Chidambaram claimed that artificial reduction of cash in circulation is one of the reasons for lower demand and lower growth .
" In interest of transparency , government / RBI should release RBI Board's agenda , background note and ( former Governor ) Dr Raghuram Rajan's note .
If government is confident of its decision , why does it fear releasing these documents ? , " he asked .

Do not always get chance to come out of conventional acting mode : Prosenjit
Kolkata , Nov 8 ( PTI ) .
Bengali superstar Prosenjit Chatterjee has said he does not always get the scope to come out from the conventional acting mode , except in very few films .
Films such as Rituparno Ghosh's ' Dosar ' or Atanu Ghosh's upcoming ' Mayurakshi ' gave him the scope to come out of the conventional mode , the actor said .
" But such scope comes on very few occasions , not regularly , " Prosenjit told PTI here yesterday .
" Many a time , thoughts come up whether we are all stuck up within the conventional acting mode , " the filmstar said .
" That does not mean I find my character in films made by other directors as monotonous .
Every film maker has his own individual style .
But definitely , when the director asks you to break yourself and then mould it again , you obviously get a bit more space , " he said .
Prosenjit will also rate ' Moner Manush ' , ' Jaatishwar ' and ' Sankhachil ' as his favourite films for following a very " simple narrative style " .
" You can see such type of films are increasingly being made in Mumbai film industry where the acting style , form and treatment back up such narratives , " he said .
Stating that each genre of film follows its own type of script , Prosenjit said , " When I turn up in a film like ' Bikram Singha ' , my acting will be different from ' Dosar ' , which will be again different in ' Yeti Obhijaan ' where I play the role of Kakababu . "
The actor also said , " each film has its own target audience . "
Speaking on the use of silence in cinema , Prosenjit again referred to ' Dosar ' which was made in 2008 and said even in ' Mayurakshi ' , where he is pitted opposite thespian Soumitra Chatterjee , there are moments , when silence is more evocative than words .
" I think , moments of silence are also not much used in Bengali films , " he felt .
Not sure if the father - son relationship in ' Mayurakshi ' , slated for release in December end , mirrors his personal ties with Soumitra Chatterjee , whom he considers next to father Biswajit Chatterjee , Prosenjit said , " Even if it does not convey the exact shades in our lives , there are real life references .
" Hence we had no difficulty in essaying the scenes although I learnt a lot from Soumitra kaku during the shots . "
ED in court to declare Vijay Mallya proclaimed offender
New Delhi , Nov 8 ( PTI ) .
The Enforcement Directorate today approached a Delhi court seeking to declare beleaguered businessman Vijay Mallya a proclaimed offender in a case of allegedly evading summons in a FERA violation matter .
Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Deepak Shehrawat is likely to take up the matter today itself .
Special Public Prosecutor N K Matta , appearing for the ED , told the court that the agency has no other option but to initiate the proceedings to declare Mallya as a proclaimed offender .
The court had on April 12 issued an open - ended non - bailable warrant against the liquor baron .
An ' open - ended NBW ' does not carry a time limit for execution unlike ' NBW ' .
On November 4 last year , while issuing non - bailable warrant against Mallya , the court had observed that he had no inclination to return and had scant regard for the law of the land .
It had said that coercive process has to be initiated against liquor baron Mallya as he was facing proceedings in several cases and evading appearance in those matters .
The court had also held that Mallya's plea , that he wanted to return to India but was " incapacitated " to travel as his passport had been revoked by Indian authorities , was " malafide " and " abuse of the process of law " .
Mallya , who is reportedly in London , had submitted before the court on September 9 that he wanted to come back to India but was " incapacitated " to travel despite " best intentions " as his passport had been revoked .
On July 9 , the court had cancelled the exemption from personal appearance granted to Mallya and directed him to appear before it on September 9 .
The exemption from personal appearance to Mallya was granted in December 2000 on ED's complaint for evading summons issued by it .
The agency had issued summons to the businessman in connection with alleged payment of USD 200,000 to a British firm for displaying Kingfisher logo in Formula One World Championships in London and some European countries in 1996 , 1997 and 1998 .
It had claimed that the money was allegedly paid without prior approval from the RBI in violation of FERA norms .
In its plea against Mallya , ED had also sought issuance of non - bailable warrant against the Chairman of the defunct Kingfisher Airlines to secure his presence in the ongoing trial of the case , which is at the final stage .
According to ED , Mallya was summoned on four occasions for questioning in connection with a contract signed in December 1995 with London - based firm Benetton Formula Ltd for promotion of the Kingfisher brand abroad .
When Mallya failed to appear before ED in response to the summons , a complaint was filed on March 8 , 2000 before a court here and later charges were framed against him under FERA .
People are conveniently targetting Dhoni : Kohli to critics
Thiruvananthapuram , Nov 8 ( PTI ) .
Livid with constant scrutiny of Mahendra Singh Dhoni's finishing skills , India captain Virat Kohli hit back at the critics for " conviniently " singling out one man while ignoring failure of other players , including himself .
Dhoni's 37 - ball - 49 in the second T20 International that India lost to New Zealand was panned by experts as he played too many dot balls .
While VVS Laxman has said that someone younger should be tried in T20s , Virender Sehwag has asked the team management to make the former skipper understand his " role in the team " .
" I don't understand why people are pointing him out .
If I fail as a batsman three times , no one is going to point fingers at me because I am not over 35 , " Kohli's sarcastic jibe at the post - match media conference was not lost on anyone .
" The guy is fit , he is passing all the tests .
He is contributing to the team in every tactical way on the field .
With the bat , he did really well against Sri Lanka ( away series ) and Australia , " the skipper reminded everyone .
Kohli said that while being critical of Dhoni , one needs to understand that how much time he is getting to bat .
" In this series , he didn't get much time to bat .
You have to understand that the position he comes in to bat , even Hardik Pandya could not score in that game so why are we pointing out one man ?
Hardik as well got out in the last T20 in Rajkot .
You are conveniently targeting one man , which is not fair . "
Kohli then elaborately explained how difficult it becomes for Dhoni when he comes into bat .
" By the time , he comes in , the run rate is already 8.5 - 9.5 .
The wicket is also not the same like when the new ball is being bowled .
Batsmen who are set at the top find it easier to strike the ball straightaway compared to guys who come lower down the order .
The kind of wickets that we played on , wear and tear has been much more in the latter half , ?
said the 29 - year - old skipper about his predecessor .
" You have to assess everything .
As team members and management , we understand the situation when people go in to bat , we don't get emotional and excited about opinions of people who are looking at things from a different point of view .
You understand how the wicket is behaving , in what situation you are in . "
Dhoni had scores of 25 , 18 not out and 25 in the three ODIs while he scored 7 not out , 49 and 0 not out in the T20s but Kohli didn't seem too worried .
" He is doing absolutely fine .
He is working hard on his game , understands his role but it doesn't come off every time .
He hit a six in Delhi and it got showed five times in the post - match show and suddenly he doesn't score in one game and we are after his life , " the India captain said .
He also advocated patience when it came to Dhoni and said no one had the right decide for him .
" People need to be a bit more patient .
He is a guy who understands where his cricket is .
He is a very smart guy and understands where he stands with his body and game .
I don't think anyone else has the right to decide that for him , " Kohli's attacking stance made it evident that team management has full faith in Dhoni .

Prince Charles backs new education bond for India
London , Nov 8 ( PTI ) .
Britain's Prince Charles , who is set to arrive in New Delhi as part of his ongoing Asian tour , has given his backing to a new development bond for India to provide education to marginalised children in the country .
The 10 - million - dollar Education Development Impact Bond ( DIB ) has been created by the British Asian Trust , founded by the Prince of Wales to fight poverty in South Asia , and is designed to improve learning outcomes for thousands of marginalised children in India .
The bond is intended as an innovative and sustainable social impact investment tool which will be tied in with performance and outcomes of educational initiatives , starting in India and then across the trust's other regions of operation .
" I hope that through the trust we can impact the lives of not just children in India but also change the mindsets of philanthropists around the world , " said Prince Charles , who will arrive in New Delhi today .
The Education Development Impact Bond has been developed by the trust alongside UBS Optimus Foundation with the aim of transforming the future of education in India .
Under the initiative , the DIB will provide funding to four local not - for - profit delivery partners in the country over four years , delivering a range of operational models including principal and teacher training , direct school management , and supplementary programmes .
It is intended to improve literacy and numeracy learning levels for over 200,000 primary school students from marginalised communities in Delhi , Gujarat and Rajasthan .
The UK government's Department for International Development ( DfID ) will contribute technical assistance and insights to the project as part of a wider partnership .
" The DfID is exploring new and innovative ways to finance programmes which will transform the lives of some of the world ? s poorest people .
We are proud to support the British Asian Trust as they develop their Development Impact Bond , which will provide access to quality education for hundreds of thousands of children , " said DfID minister Priti Patel .
The bond has been described as a step towards a greater focus on social impact financing as a transformational tool for philanthropy .
The concept of Development Impact Bonds is intended as a result - oriented way to attract new capital into development , with a strong emphasis on data and evidence .
Richard Hawkes , Chief Executive of the British Asian Trust , explains : " At the heart of our programme strategy is a real determination to continue applying business principles to the work .
We are convinced that only by applying these to philanthropy and to development are you really able to meet the needs of the greatest number of people . "
Sir Ronald Cohen , international philanthropist and a champion of global impact investing , described the British Asian Trust's initiative as " ground - breaking " and capable of delivering vital social improvement at scale .
In India , Prince Charles will meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi for bilateral talks as part of a series of events planned during his two - day visit with wife Camilla , Duchess of Cornwall .
Trump denounces ' cruel dictatorship ' of North Korea
Seoul , Nov 8 ( AFP ) .
US President Donald Trump slammed North Korea's " cruel dictatorship " and the severe political oppression inflicted by the regime in a speech to Seoul's parliament today .
" Far from valuing its people as equal citizens , this cruel dictatorship measures them , scores them , and ranks them based on the most arbitrary indication of their allegiance to the state , " Trump said in the address .
" Those who score the highest in loyalty may live in the capital city .
Those who score the lowest starve , " he said in the first address to the national assembly in Seoul by a US head of state in 24 years .
The Demilitarized Zone that splits the Korean peninsula in two was , Trump said , " the line that today divides the oppressed and the free " .
The North's ruling Kim family has ruled the impoverished , isolated country with an iron fist and pervasive personality cult for three generations , showing no tolerance for political dissent .
The regime has for decades been criticised for a range of rights abuses including torture , rape and execution of perceived critics or those trying to flee the country .
It is also known to operate multiple prison camps across the country where hundreds of thousands languish under forced labour and starvation .
Trump noted many cases of such abuses , including " a nine - year - old boy . . . imprisoned for ten years because his grandfather was accused of treason . "
" The horror of life in North Korea is so complete , that citizens pay bribes to government officials to have themselves exported abroad as slaves , " he said .

Trump arrives in China for wide ranging talks with Xi
Beijing , Nov 8 ( PTI ) .
US President Donald Trump arrived here today to hold wide ranging talks with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping on a host of issues , including ramping up pressure on North Korea to abandon its nuclear programme and trade frictions between the two most powerful economies .
Both countries are also expected to sign trade deals worth billions of dollars during Trump's three - day visit .
China is pulling out all the stops to give a " state visit - plus " reception to Trump on his maiden visit .
Chinese officials projected the visit as a defining moment in China - US ties as it is taking place in the " new era " of Xi , who commenced his second tenure less than a fortnight ago as the most powerful leader of China after Mao Zedong .
Trump ? s programme here will start with tea with his Chinese counterpart Xi .
Later the two leaders will visit China's iconic Forbidden City , adjacent to the Tiananmen Square followed by a private dinner .
Trump will be given an extended ceremonial welcome at the Great Hall of the People tomorrow followed by bilateral talks with Xi .
Later Trump would also take part in a business event followed by joint media event .
Trump is also scheduled to meet Chinese Premier Li Keqiang and attend a reception followed by state dinner and cultural performance .
The visit will provide opportunities for President Xi and Trump to exchange in - depth views on issues that concern both sides , Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a media briefing yesterday .
The visit is of great significance in pushing forward the steady development of Sino - US relations in the new era and promoting the prosperity of not only the Asia - Pacific region but also the world , she said .
Terry Branstad , US ambassador to China , said that the meeting between the two presidents will be helpful in resolving " thorny issues " .
" There is a lot of excitement and feelings that this could be very historic and significant for the Trump - Xi meeting here , " he said .
" I think the chemistry between the two leaders is good , and that bodes well .
If the two leaders can get along well and work out some of the differences , hopefully that can help the rest of us to work things out well , " he added .
Since Trump took office in January , the two leaders have maintained close contact .
They already have had two face - to - face meetings and eight phone conversations .
Branstad also said a number of memorandums of understanding are expected to be signed during Trump's visit , covering manufacturing , energy and other sectors .
Trump's visit marks the first by a head of state to China after last month's once - in - a - five year Congress of the ruling Communist Party of China , which conferred a second five - year term for Xi .
" The visit will be different from routine arrangements and there will be surprises , " Ni Feng , deputy director of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences ' Institute of American Studies said .
Many Chinese are concerned about the future of bilateral ties , and how the two countries will interact over the North Korea ? s nuclear and missile programme , An Gang , a senior research fellow at the Pangoal Institution , a Beijing - based think tank , said .
Xi and Trump spent over seven hours together in April at the US president's Mar - a - Lago estate in the US state of Florida where the two leaders worked out a 100 - day plan to boost economic cooperation .
After a deal to reopen the Chinese markets to the US for beef in July , American beef is back on China's menu .
China says the action plan has produced some tangible results .
Ahead of his visit , Trump has said the massive trade deficit in bilateral trade is a shame , and has been putting pressure on China to open the Chinese markets more for US products and firms .
US goods and services trade with China totalled to an estimated USD 648.2 billion in 2016 in which China had a lion's share with about USD 478.9 billion exports .
The US exports to China stood at USD 169.3 billion , according to US trade figures .
Trump is also putting pressure on Xi to press China's close ally North Korea to give up the nuclear and missile programme which has become a major threat to the US .
Trump yesterday said Xi had been " very helpful " in dealing with the threat posed by nuclear - armed North Korea .
The two leaders will also discuss major issues of common concern , Zheng said , noting that the meeting is of great significance to Sino - US relations and to peace , stability and prosperity in the Asia - Pacific region and the world .
Also expected to figure in Trump - Xi discussion is the US ' new South Asia policy which is piling pressure on Pakistan , China's all - weather ally , to dismantle terror safe havens .
China is also apprehensive about the US trying to work out a quadrilateral with India , Japan and Australia .
Japan has proposed the four countries to work out a new Silk Road plan to counter China's ambitious and multi - billion dollar Belt and Road Initiative .
The US has been accusing China of violating international rules and norms by laying claims on the disputed South and East China seas .
China claims sovereignty on almost all of the South China Sea ( SCS ) which is disputed by Vietnam , the Philippines , Malaysia , Brunei and Taiwan .
China has also laid claims on the Senkaku islands under the control of Japan in East China Sea and resorted to aggressive patrols in the last two years .
The US calls the dominance of China over the SCS a threat to national interest in freedom of navigation .

Modi turned people's anger into communal hatred : Rahul
New Delhi , Nov 8 ( PTI ) .
Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi today accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of " robbing " the country of its economic prowess and " damaging " India by converting people's anger due to joblessness into " communal hatred " .
On the first anniversary of demonetisation , which he termed as a " tragedy " , Gandhi said livelihood of millions of honest Indians were destroyed due to this " thoughtless act " of the prime minister .
" Modi's reforms have robbed India of its economic prowess , " he alleged in an article in ' Financial Times ' that said demonetisation has wiped out 2 per cent of ? GDP and " ruined " the lives of millions of workers .
Gandhi said the prime minister claimed his decision was aimed at wiping out corruption , but " Twelve months on the only thing he has wiped out is confidence in our once booming economy " .
The Congress vice president alleged that demonetisation destroyed the informal labour sector and has wiped out many small and medium businesses .
" Mr Modi has damaged India by converting anger created by joblessness and lack of economic opportunity into communal hatred .
" He has chosen to hide behind a shallow , hate - filled political narrative .
Anger might have brought Mr Modi to power but it will never create jobs or fix India ? s institutions , " he said in the article .
Taking a poetic dig at the government , he tweeted in Hindi that even a single tear spelt danger for the government and one has not seen an ocean coming out of the eyes , tagging a picture of some poor people crying while standing in queues .
" Demonetisation is a tragedy .
We stand with millions of honest Indians , whose lives and livelihoods were destroyed by PM ? s thoughtless act , " he said on Twitter .
" Ek aansu bhi hukumat ke liye khatra hai , tumne dekha nahin aankhon ka samundar hona " ( Even a single tear is a danger for the government , you have not seen eyes turning into an ocean ) , " he said in another tweet .
The Congress , which described note ban decision as the " biggest scam " and a " money laundering scheme " , will observe the demonetisation anniversary as " black day " by taking out countrywide protests in the form of processions , rallies and candle - light marches .
Congress leaders will pan out across the country and will participate in protests with " Desh Bhugat Raha hai " and " India suffers " as the central theme for the day .
Gandhi is in poll - bound Gujarat to participate in protests in Surat , the country's diamond and textile hub .
Quoting the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy , Gandhi said 1.5 million people have lost their jobs in the first four months of 2017 due to demonetisation , which he termed as an " arbitrary and unilateral " decision of the prime minister .
He also said the " hastily imposed and poorly conceptualised " goods and services tax " dealt another blow to our economy " .
" Bureaucratic and complex , it ( GST ) has devastated livelihoods , creating a modern day ' Licence Raj ' that imposes rigid controls and gives vast powers to government officials , " he said .
Gandhi , in his article , lauded the Chinese dominance in the manufacturing sector with its global share rising from 3 per cent in 1990s to 25 per cent now , and said that while China creates 50,000 jobs a day , India under Modi creates mere 500 jobs a day .
" This advantage comes with a brutal cost ?
China's people are not free to speak , to dissent or to question and those that do are swiftly and severely punished .
This is not a model India should emulate , " he , however , said .
Quoting Chinese president Deng Xiaoping that it doesn't matter what colour the cat is as long as it catches mouse , Gandhi said " Today , the Chinese cat has firmly caught the global manufacturing mouse " .
" The challenge for liberal democracies across the world is to compete with Chinese organisation in a world with 21st - century levels of connectivity , while maintaining our liberal values .
" China ? s global monopoly on blue - collar jobs is a fundamental challenge to other states .
This has created millions of disenfranchised and angry workers who express their frustration at the ballot box ?
whether in votes for Mr Modi , Brexit , or Donald Trump , " he said .
" The rise of democratically elected autocrats , such as Mr Modi , is driven by two factors : a massive increase in connectivity and its profound impact on institutions ; and , second , China's dominance of the global job market .
" Connectivity and the transparency it inspires has positively transformed the world , but in doing so it has also irreparably damaged the machinery of our institutions .
The resulting fragmentation has created an environment in which strongmen can flourish apparently unchecked , " he said .
Demonetisation struck blow to anti - India forces : Parrikar
Panaji , Nov 8 ( PTI ) .
Former Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar today said demonetisation has struck a blow to anti - India forces and empowered the poorest of poor through an increase in financial inclusion and formalisation of the economy .
A year after the Centre's decision to ban Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes , the chief minister of Goa commented on the move on Twitter .
" Through increase in financial inclusion & formalisation of our economy , # Demonetisation empowered the poorest of poor , " Parrikar said in a tweet .
" Terrorism & naxalism thrives on unaccounted cash & black money .
# Demonetisation has struck a blow to anti - India forces , " he said in another tweet .
In another tweet , the senior BJP leader said , " # Demonetisation was a reformist measure to weed out black money , strengthen our economy , & establish good governance . "
Parrikar was the defence minister between November 2014 and March this year .
He resigned in March to take over as the chief minister of Goa .
On November 8 last year , Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced the scrapping of Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 notes as a measure to fight blackmoney , corruption , fake currency and terror funding .
The BJP earlier announced that it will mark the first anniversary of demonetisation as ' anti - blackmoney day ' , setting up a political tug of war with opposition parties which have planned to observe it as a " black day " .
Mary Kom strikes gold at Asian Championships
Ho Chi Minh City ( Vietnam ) , Nov 8 ( PTI ) .
The redoubtable M C Mary Kom ( 48kg ) notched up her fifth gold medal at the Asian Women's Boxing Championships , winning a fiercely - contested summit clash here today .
Up against North Korea's Kim Hyang Mi , the five - time world champion and Olympic bronze - medallist Indian prevailed in a unanimous 5 - 0 verdict to add another accolade to her already crowded cabinet .
This is Mary Kom's first international gold medal since the 2014 Asian Games and her first medal in over a year .
In Hyang Mi , the 35 - year - old Mary Kom found her most aggressive opponent so far in the tournament but she was up for the task .
Unlike her previous bouts , in which the opening three minutes were invariably spent measuring up the rival , both the boxers were lunging at each other within seconds of the bell going off .
Matched quite evenly in speed and precision , Mary Kom scored for her ringcraft , which included some fine footwork to outpace Hyang Mi at crucial junctures .
There was hardly any power - hitting on display but the contest was made engaging by the boxers ' fast - paced exchange of punches .
The North Korean was relentless with her left hooks but the Manipuri did not allow herself to be rattled and scored on counter - attack with her combination blows .
SC to hear AIFF's plea challenging HC order on November 10
New Delhi , Nov 8 ( PTI ) .
The Supreme Court today agreed to hear on Friday a plea by All India Football Federation ( AIFF ) challenging the Delhi High Court verdict setting aside the election of NCP leader Praful Patel as the president of the sports body .
AIFF's counsel mentioned the matter before a bench comprising Justices J Chelameswar and S Abdul Nazeer and sought a stay on the high court's October 31 order , which had also appointed former Chief Election Commissioner S Y Quraishi as the administrator - cum - returning officer to conduct fresh polls to the sport body .
The counsel sought urgent listing of the matter contending that AIFF has to bid for hosting the FIFA Under - 20 World Cup and the last date to submit the bid was November 14 .
" The high court had set aside the election of AIFF committee .
We are seeking a stay on it ( high court's order ) .
Under the FIFA Rules , a country is recognised only if there is an elected body and if there is no elected body , a country is derecognised by the FIFA , " the AIFF counsel told the bench .
The bench , after hearing the brief submissions , said the plea would be heard on November 10 .
The high court had set aside the election of Patel as the president of the sports body observing that the AIFF Rules were in breach of the National Sports Code and Model Guidelines .
Patel , a former minister of civil aviation and heavy industries , was elected for a four - year term in December last year along with the Executive Committee for 2017 - 2020 , after the high court had , as an interim measure , vacated the stay on the polls on the ground that the result would be subject to the final outcome of the issue pending before it .
The high court had directed that fresh elections should be held in accordance with the model guidelines .
It had said the administrator should conduct the polls by resolving the issue of disaffiliation of members / units of AIFF as on November 30 , 2016 and preparing the electoral list within a month by giving two weeks notice to the parties .
The high court had said that till the elections are conducted and the results declared in consonance with the National Sports Code and in compliance with its directions , the AIFF should not make any new financial commitments , except with the administrator's prior approval .
The court passed the interim order on an application by the AIFF seeking vacation and modification of its December 15 last year's order staying the election process .
The National Sports Code is a set of guidelines issued by the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports in 2011 to ensure that National Sports Federations ( NSFs ) dependent on government funding are made accountable and transparent .

Sri Lanka begin testing India tour with warm up game
Kolkata , Nov 10 ( PTI ) .
Chasing an elusive dream of winning their first cricket Test in India , Sri Lanka will begin their gruelling tour with a two - day tour fixture against a depleted Board President's XI here tomorrow .
Sri Lanka who will play their first Test in India since 2009 - 10 have a forgettable record in the country as they are yet to win from 16 appearances and have suffered 10 defeats in their head - to - head record spanning 1982 - 2017 .
It's an improbable task for skipper Dinesh Chandimal who will play his maiden Test in India and would bank upon the experience of Angelo Mathews and Rangana Herath the only two members who were part of their side which suffered 0 - 2 defeat seven years back .
Having suffered a 0 - 9 humiliation at home across three formats , the Islanders are here in India in a gap of two months but with a confidence - boosting surprise 2 - 0 Test series win over Pakistan in UAE last month .
The Lankans will play three Tests and as many ODIs and T20Is in the long series concluding in Mumbai on December 24 .
Chandimal and Co . will hope to start well against a third - string Board's side led by Sanju Samson .
The match is scheduled at the Jadavpur University second campus ground , the deck of which primarily supports seam bowling .
Giving importance to the Ranji Trophy , the Board has opted for a third - string outfit primarily comprising of players from - - Hyderabad , Kerala , Madhya Pradesh and Punjab who are not featuring in the ongoing fifth round of the domestic tournament .
In such a scenario , it will hardly give the Islanders a perfect build up .
For Sri Lanka the spotlight will be on former captain and ace all - rounder Mathews who will make a return after missing the entire series against Pakistan .
Having recovered from a calf muscle injury , Mathews was in full flow in their first practice here as he will look to get into rhythm ahead of the first Test at Eden Gardens from November 16 - 20 .
Having bagged 16 wickets against Pakistan , senior - most spinner Rangana Herath will eye a rich haul here as he will lead the spin department .
Giving the 39 - year - old company will be left - arm chinaman Lakshan Sandakan who bagged a five - wicket haul against India in Pallekele in their third and final Test in August .
Fresh from his 93 and 196 against Pakistan , left - handed opener Dimuth Karunaratne will look to continue from where he left in Abu Dhabi as they will also bank heavily on skipper Chandimal and Niroshan Dickwella in batting department .
Chandimal also has a century against Pakistan while Dickwella was their third leading run - getter in Abu Dhabi with two half - centuries .
The Board squad has in - form Punjab youngster Anmolpreet Singh , who scored a career - best 267 in the last round Ranji Trophy match against Chhattisgarh .
He was drafted in after Naman Ojha , who was originally named captain , was ruled out due to an injury .
Punjab opener Jiwanjot Singh , who led their side against Himachal Pradesh in absence of Harbhajan Singh and Yuvraj Singh , too finds a place in the team .
There's also Punjab batsman Abhishek Gupta , who scored a double century in his first - class debut in the season opener against Himachal Pradesh .
B Sandeep , Tanmay Agarwal and Rohan Prem are the other members in the batting department .
The pace department consists of Sandeep Warrier from Kerala and Avesh Khan from Madhya Pradesh .
MP all - rounder Jalaj Saxena , who now plays for Kerala , will lead the spin department , assisted by Hyderabad ? s leg - spinner Akash Bhandari in the squad , coached by former wrist spinner Narendra Hirwani .
Squads : Sri Lanka : Dinesh Chandimal ( captain ) , Dimuth Karunaratne , Sadeera Samarawickrama , Lahiru Thirimanne ( vice - captain ) , Niroshan Dickwella ( wicketkeeper ) , Dilruwan Perera , Rangana Herath , Suranga Lakmal , Lahiru Gamage , Dhananjaya de Silva , Angelo Mathews , Lakshan Sandakan , Vishwa Fernando , Dasun Shanaka and Roshen Silva .

Kolkata , Nov 10 ( PTI ) .
Minerals worth at least Rs 50,000 crore can be auctioned from 13 - 15 blocks in the remaining four months of the current fiscal with the upcoming proposed amendments in the auctioning rules , a top official of the Ministry of Mines said .
These 13 - 15 mines could include limestone , iron ore , emerald and molybdenum among others .
" We would like the progress to pick up .
We are certainly hoping that we will easily cross the Rs one lakh crore figure for the current year , with new 13 - 15 blocks expected in the remaining four months of FY18 , " Union Mines secretary Arun Kumar said here last evening .
He was speaking on the sidelines of the golden jubilee celebration of Hindustan Copper Ltd .
" We have auctioned about Rs 50,000 crore worth of minerals from 12 mines in this financial year so far , ?
the senior official said .
The government has been able to auction Rs 1.80 lakh crore worth of minerals for 33 mines during the last two years , he said .
The Mines ministry was in the process of bringing some amendments to fuel an interest from private investors in the mining sector , after some concerns were raised .
" The amendments are now with the Ministry of Law for its approval and the notification of the proposed amendments can be expected by this November , " Kumar said .
The proposed amendments will relax the eligibility criteria , norms for states using discretion in bidding process , making end use terms more favourable , adjustment of royalty and fees from the upfront fees paid by the successful bidder and giving timeline to begin operations block winners .
Kumar said , these new provisions are expected to bring the auction process " easier and attractive " .

The finance ministers of Congress ruled states last week demanded a major overhaul of the Goods and Services Tax ( GST ) , alleging that the tax reform measure had turned out to be a " big disappointment " due to its " poor " implementation .
The finance ministers of the Congress - ruled Punjab and Karnataka , Manpreet Badal and Krishna Gowda , alleged that the country had " lost the opportunity " to bring tax reform and that there was " utter chaos and confusion " , forcing many businesses to shut down .

UP traffic cops to don blue trousers from Dec 1
Lucknow , Nov 10 ( PTI ) .
Come December 1 , Uttar Pradesh traffic police will once again don blue trousers instead of the existing khaki - a light shade of yellow and brown .
" At a meeting of the DGP , it was unanimously decided by officers to change the colour of khaki trousers to blue from December 1 .
It has been done to give the traffic police a separate identify , " a senior official said here .
Now traffic cops will wear white shirts and blue trousers for which the government has sanctioned Rs 2,250 per year to a cop for the uniform .
During the BSP regime , Mayawati had changed the uniform of traffic police from white to blue on April 1 , 2008 , stating that white colour gets dirty easily .
The Samajwadi Party had protested the move alleging that the colour blue was similar to the uniform of BSP volunteers .
" It is just a stunt to promote the colour of the ruling BSP government .
Now , one can even get confused with the BSP's volunteer force and the traffic police , as both are dressed in blue , " Samajwadi Party had said .
In 2012 , when the SP came to the power , Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav reversed the Mayawati government's decision and changed the colour of state traffic police's uniform from blue to khaki on July 1 , 2012 .
Blue is considered a favourite of the BSP .
The then SP government had said that the reason behind the change of colour was that it resembled that of private security agencies and was confusing .
SC rejects TMC MLA's plea against linking Aadhaar with bank accounts
New Delhi , Nov 10 ( PTI ) .
The Supreme Court today refused to entertain a plea filed by a Trinamool Congress ( TMC ) MLA challenging the linking of bank accounts with Aadhaar .
The apex court said there were several petitions challenging Aadhaar which were already pending before it and it cannot entertain thousands of pleas raising similar issue .
" Why should we entertain thousands of petitions on the same issue .
These issues have already been raised in other petitions .
We will permit you to raise this issues through impleadment application before the Constitution Bench , " a bench comprising Justices A K Sikri and Ashok Bhushan said .
The bench permitted TMC MLA Mahua Moitra to file an application for impleadment as a party in the pending matters which are scheduled to come up before a Constitution Bench in the last week of this month .
Advocate Zoheb Hossain , representing the Unique Identification Authority of India ( UIDAI ) , told the bench that 27 petitions related to Aadhaar are already pending consideration before the apex court .
When Moitra's counsel requested the bench to hear the matter , Justice Sikri observed , " I think each and every aspect of Aadhaar has already been challenged in court . "
" Since so many petitions are pending consideration before the court , it may not be appropriate to entertain this PIL , " the bench said .
The apex court had on November 3 made it clear that banks and telecom service providers will have to indicate the last date of linking bank accounts and mobile numbers with Aadhaar in their communications with customers .
Currently , the last date to link Aadhaar with bank accounts is December 31 this year while for mobile numbers , it is February 6 , 2018 .
However , the top court did not pass any interim order on the pleas challenging the constitutional validity of the Aadhaar Act as well as linking of 12 - digit unique biometric identification number with bank accounts and mobile numbers .
Earlier , the court had issued notice to the Centre on four separate pleas and tagged them with the main petition which would come up for final hearing before a constitution bench .
On October 30 , a bench headed by the CJI had said that a constitution bench would be constituted and Aadhaar - related matters would come up for hearing before it in November last .
Statue of Bhupen Hazarika erected in Arunachal
( Recasting the Intro ) Itanagar , Nov 10 ( PTI ) .
The Arunachal Pradesh government has erected a statue of legendary music composer and singer Bhupen Hazarika at Bolung village in Dibang Valley district of the state .
The ten feet bronze statue , sculpted by Biren Singh of Guwahati , was erected in the village this year .
It would be formally unveiled tentatively in the early part of 2018 , an official told PTI .
" The state government had allocated Rs 30 lakh for the statue in 2015 as a tribute to the legendary singer who contributed a lot for the state in the cultural field .
Bhupen da is more an Arunachalee than an Assamese , " Director of Research Department Batem Pertin said .
The Bolung village is adjacent to Assam's Sadiya area where his parents lived .
He often carried to the village by elders .
Later as a boy he also moved around the village frequently , an official said .
Pertin said that the government in 2016 - 17 also allocated 70 lakh for erection of two statues of Hazarika at Yazali in Lower Subansiri district and Itanagar .
Pertin , who is also the general secretary of the Arunachal Pradesh Literary Society ( APLS ) , said that due to persuasion of the society , the government approved the Bolung project .
" The land for erecting the statue was donated by the sons of former MLA of Arunachal Pradesh Provisional Legislative Assembly Gora Pertin as a tribute to Hazarika , " Pertin said .
" Bhupen da through his songs tried to unite the entire north eastern states in a single string .
He not only composed songs for Assam but for all the NE states , ?
he said .
Interesting anecdote of Hazarika's childhood is that as an infant he was once lost by his parents and he spent a couple of days in a tribal family at Bolung village .
He was later returned to his parents by a young girl of the Adi tribe .
" Once Bhupen da had said that he was an Arunachalee because he was breastfed by an Arunachalee mother when he was lost in childhood , " Trade and Commerce Director Tokong Pertin said .
In a region ravaged by years of insurgency , Hazarika had been a voice of moderation .
For years his revolutionary lyrics bearing powerful messages of social change have resounded in the hamlets and valleys of the north eastern region .
Hazarika also produced the first Arunachalee content based film in Hindi ?
' Mera Maa Mera Dharam ' in 1976 and shot his Assamese film ' Rashmi Rekha ' in 1971 - 72 in Arunachal .

Developing world says rich nations shirking on climate
Paris , Nov 10 ( AFP ) .
The failure of wealthy nations to deliver on short - term climate commitments could hinder the rollout of a landmark treaty , a bloc of 134 developing countries , including India and China , have warned at UN negotiations in Bonn .
The diplomatic spat has underscored the difficulty of reaching a consensus at the 196 - nation talks .
" If we do not respect decisions that we have made , then how can we build trust among the parties ? "
said Chen Zhihua , China's senior negotiator , referring to long - standing pledges by rich nations to enhance financial support and " revisit " targets for curbing greenhouse gas emissions before 2020 .
" And how can we lay a good foundation for the implementation of the Paris Agreement ? "
he added at a press conference yesterday , flanked by diplomats from India , Iran , Nicaragua and Ecuador .
The treaty , inked outside the French capital in 2015 , calls on the world to cap global warming at " well below " two degrees Celsius , and even 1.5 C if possible .
With one degree of warming so far , the planet has already seen an increase in drought , deadly heatwaves and superstorms .
The pact rests on voluntary carbon - cutting pledges from virtually every country in the world .
" The science is clear : if we don't get our act together before 2020 , you can forget about the 2 C and 1.5 C targets , " said Paul Oquist , Nicaragua's chief negotiator at the talks .
" There has been a failure to comply with existing commitments , " he added .
Under the terms of the UN's core climate convention , the burden for action before 2020 falls mainly on wealthy countries historically responsible for the rapid rise of greenhouse gases .
China is the world's top carbon polluter , followed by the United States , the European Union , India and Russia .
Developing countries sought to have a " pre - 2020 agenda " formally added to the negotiating process , but the move was shelved at the start of the 12 - day talks .
Efforts to resolve the issue have so far been fruitless .
" It would be a bad thing if this hangs over into the second week and becomes a political issue for ministers , " said Alden Meyer , director of strategy and policy for the Union of Concerned Scientists in Washington DC .
" It has been a pretty sterile debate that has degenerated into a finger - pointing exercise , " he told AFP .
Some 20 heads of state , including French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel , are scheduled to appear at the UN climate forum next week .

Itanagar , Nov 10 ( PTI ) .

The ten feet bronze statue , sculpted by Biren Singh of Guwahati , was erected in the village this year .

Pentagon must show Pak repercussions of supporting terror : US lawmakers
Washington , Nov 10 ( PTI ) .
The Pentagon must " demonstrate " to Pakistan the " consequences " of continued support to terrorists , US Congressional leaders have said as they backed President Donald Trump's new South Asia policy .
Trump in August unveiled America's new policy for South Asia and Afghanistan , criticising Pakistan for providing safe havens to terrorists .
The bipartisan group of Congressional leaders , reconciling the differences between the House and Senate versions of the 2018 National defense Authorisation Act ( NDAA ) , also urged the Department of Defense to closely monitor US security assistance to Pakistan and ensure that the country does not use it to support terrorist groups .
The lawmakers , in a joint report of the Senate and House Armed Services committees released yesterday , asked the Pentagon to " demonstrate to Pakistan the consequences of continued support to terrorists " .
Such a demand from lawmakers comes days after the Indian security forces recovered US - made rifle meant for Pakistan from a terrorist in Jammu and Kashmir .
A carbine Colt recovered from an encounter site in Pulwama district , where three Jaish - e - Mohammed ( JeM ) militants , including its chief Masood Azhar ? s nephew Talha Rashid , were killed on Monday night .
The US State Department refused to respond to a question on recovery of equipment from terrorists .
" We refer you to the government of India regarding their investigation into this matter , " a State Department spokesperson told PTI .
In another move , the House receded its amendment to remove the Lashkar - e - Taiba ( LeT ) from the certification requirements not eligible for a national security waiver .
The reconciled version of the NDAA - 2018 now makes USD 350 million of USD 700 million available to Pakistan under coalition support fund ( CSF ) contingent upon certification from the Secretary of Defense that Pakistan is taking demonstrable steps against the Haqqani Network .
In the last two years , two successive US defense secretaries - - Ashton Carter and his successor Jim Mattis - - refused to give such a certification to Pakistan , in the absence of Islamabad taking demonstrable and satisfactory actions against the Haqqani network .
The lawmakers , however , noted that action on the part of the Government of Pakistan against the LeT , as well as other terrorist groups operating within the borders of Pakistan , remains a priority for the US , according to the voluminous conference report .
The conferees expressed concern about the persecution of groups seeking political or religious freedom in Pakistan , including the Balochi , Sindhi and Hazara ethnic groups , as well as Christians , Hindus and Ahmadiyya Muslims .
Consequently , the conferees believe that the Secretary of Defense should ensure that Pakistan is not using any assistance provided by the United States to persecute minority groups , the report said .
Trump says Asia held hostage by N Korea's ' twisted fantasies '
Danang ( Vietnam ) , Nov 10 ( AFP ) .
US President Donald Trump today said the Asia - Pacific region was being held hostage by the " twisted fantasies " of North Korean leader Kim Jong - Un , as he called on countries to stand united against Pyongyang .
Trump has embarked on a tour of Asia this week trying to rally regional support for curbing North Korea's nuclear weapons programme , warning that time is running out over the crisis .
" The future of this region and its beautiful people must not be held hostage to a dictator's twisted fantasies of violent conquest and nuclear blackmail , " he said during a speech in Vietnam to the annual Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation ( APEC ) forum .
The region , he added , must " stand united in declaring that every single step the North Korean regime takes toward more weapons is a step it takes into greater and greater danger " .
The US administration thinks China's economic leverage over North Korea is the key to strong - arming Pyongyang into halting its nuclear weapons and missile programmes .
Yesterday , Trump was in Beijing meeting President Xi Jinping , where he called on China to " act fast " over North Korea .
" China can fix this problem easily and quickly , and I am calling on China and your great president to hopefully work on it very hard , " he said .
Washington has also worked in recent months to convince allies across Asia to oppose Pyongyang , an issue that will remain prominent during his two day trip to Vietnam , which is currently hosting a major regional summit .
Alongside Trump , the leaders of Japan , Russia , China and South Korea are also attending the APEC summit .

Masked men assault guards outside AMU proctor's house
Aligarh ( UP ) , Nov 10 ( PTI ) .
Over a dozen masked men barged into the compound of the Aligarh Muslim University Pro Vice Chancellor Prof Tabassum Shahaab and allegedly assaulted security personnel deployed there , police said today .
The incident took place yesterday night when the masked men entered the compound , allegedly assaulted security personnel and smashed window panes but could not enter the house .
After hurling abuses at the guards , they escaped before police arrived on the scene .
The incident came hours after the university had taken disciplinary action against two students and suspended them .
An FIR was also filed against the students for their alleged involvement in vandalism on campus .
According to an official release of AMU , an FIR was filed at the Civil Lines police station yesterday night against unidentified person .
AMU officials said the entire campus unrest is " part of a wider conspiracy to destabilise the newly appointed vice chancellor by vested interests " .
AMU Proctor Prof Mohsin khan told PTI that a video footage of yesterday night's violence had been handed over to police .
He said preliminary inputs indicated that " hired professional from outside the campus were involved in yesterday night's attack " .

Trump will not meet with Putin in Vietnam : White House
Danang ( Vietnam ) , Nov 10 ( AFP ) .
US President Donald Trump will not hold a meeting with Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of a regional summit in Vietnam , the White House said today after the two countries sent mixed messages about the encounter .
Relations between Moscow and Washington have plummeted as a US probe has accused Trump's former campaign aides of secretly meeting Kremlin - connected officials - a charge Moscow denies .
Both leaders are attending the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation ( APEC ) forum in the city of Danang and there had been conflicting indications as to whether a face - to - face was on the cards .
" Regarding a Putin meeting , there was never a meeting confirmed , and there will not be one that takes place due to scheduling conflicts on both sides , " press secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters just before Air Force One touched down in the Vietnamese beach resort city .
However Moscow on Friday was holding out for a potential meeting between the two leaders , who will be in Vietnam for the next two days .
" There is no clarity yet , " Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov was quoted as saying by Russian news agencies , adding that officials were " continuing " attempts to agree on a meeting .
Both Moscow and Trump had previously suggested that talks were likely to take place .
On Sunday the US president said " it's expected we'll meet with Putin " to discuss North Korea's nuclear ambitions .
Four days later Kremlin aide Yury Ushakov told Russian news agencies that the two would hold a meeting in Vietnam with the time and place still to be determined .
But hours later US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said no decision had been made on talks , which would be the first between the two men since they met at the G20 summit in Germany in July .
Trump's relationship with Moscow has haunted the first year of his administration .
His former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and an associate are under house arrest on charges including conspiracy to launder money , linked to the investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller into allegations that the campaign colluded with Russia .
Russia has denied allegations of interfering in the US election last year that brought Trump to power .

Tiger electrocuted in Maha , ; 2nd death this month in Vidarbha
Chandrapur ( Maha ) , Nov 10 ( PTI ) .
A tiger was found electrocuted at a farm in the district , the second such death of the striped animals reported this month Maharashtra's Vidarbha region .
Notably , farmers in some places put up high voltage electric fencing around their farms to protect crops , and sometimes tigers become its victims .
A forest official said to prevent such incidents , they are planning to make farmers aware about solar fencing around their fields .
In the latest case , an adult tiger was found electrocuted at a farm in Chimur range of a forest area under Chandrapur's Brahmapuri division on November 7 , the official said .
An investigation in the incident is underway , Chief Conservator of Forests , Chandrapur division , Vijay Shelke said today .
Prior to this incident , a radio - collared tigress was found dead on November 3 in Chamorshi tehsil under the Chaprala Wildlife Sanctuary in Gadchiroli district , with electrocution being the possible cause of death , a senior forest official had said .
The tigress had killed two persons and several animals in Armori Wadsa area in the past , after which it was captured and released in the Chaprala Wildlife Sanctuary in August this year .
Earlier in April , a sub - adult tiger , named Srinivas , was found electrocuted in Brahmapuri division of Chandrapur .
Shelke pointed out that the deaths of these tigers occurred on farm lands and not precisely in forest areas .
" We manage only forest areas and our department with limited staff has no control over non - forested areas .
Our staff is always alert but if tigers stray into farms and villages , we can hardly offer any protection , " he said .
" We are initiating steps to educate farmers about changing their crop patterns to minimise the destruction to their crops by herbivores , like wild boars and nilgai ( blue bulls ) , " the official said .
" In addition , we are also planning to make the farmers aware about solar fencing and chain - linked fencing for the protection of their crops , " Shelke said .
Further , he said , the incidents of eletrocution of tigers could be checked when the public's perception changes about the wild animals .
Meanwhile , Chandrapur's Tadoba - Andhari Tiger Reserve's deputy director ( buffer zone ) , Gajendra Narwane , said the provision of solar fencing around farms may not be a complete solution in checking such incidents .
" We may have to adopt a different strategy in these ( man - animal ) conflict - prone areas to tackle the issue and creating awareness about wildlife among the people may also be of some valuable significance , " he said .

The 193 members of the UN General Assembly and 15 of the Security Council will reconvene on Monday to decide between Bhandari , 70 , and Greenwood , 62 .
Based in The Hague , the International Court of Justice ( ICJ ) has a bench of 15 judges , five of whom are elected every three years for a nine - year term .
Established in 1945 , the role of the ICJ is to settle , in accordance with international law , legal disputes submitted to it by states and to give advisory opinions on legal questions .
Along with justice Bhandari and justice Greenwood , three others - - Ronny Abraham of France , Ant ? nio Augusto Can ? ado Trindade of Brazil and Abdulqawi Ahmed Yusuf of Somalia - - were seeking re - election .
Their terms expire on February 5 , 2018 .
Nawaf Salam of Lebanon was also in the fray , making a total of six candidate for five positions .
Judges of France , Somalia , Lebanon and Brazil were elected after fourth round of voting late in the afternoon , as they received absolute majority in both the General Assembly and the Security Council elections .
Stakes are now high for both India and Britain for the last seat .
In the fourth round , Bhandari received a majority - - 115 votes - - in the General Assembly , while Greenwood received 76 votes .
However , in the 15 - member Security Council Greenwood got majority ( nine ) of the votes as against six votes by Bhandari .
As a result , another round of votes has been scheduled for Monday .
As per the United Nation's ICJ election rules , candidates need to get absolute majority in both the General Assembly and the Security Council .
Both elections are held simultaneously but independently of each other .
That means 97 votes in the Assembly and eight votes in the Security Council are required to win the ICJ election .
Several rounds of elections were held today at the General Assembly and the Security Council in the absence of any candidates getting absolute majority .
A former judge of the Supreme Court , Bhandari was elected to the International Court of Justice in April 27 , 2012 following a vacancy after the resignation of sitting court judge Awn Shawkat Al - Khasawneh from Jordon on being appointed as the Prime Minister .
Bhandari had received 122 votes in the UN General assembly as against 58 for Florentino Feliciano from the Philippines .
The ICJ , on India's petition in May , stayed the execution of Indian national and former naval officer Kulbhushan Jadhav who was sentenced to death by a Pakistan military court on the charge of " spying " .
Modi govt's performance should be judged after term ends : Min
Kolkata , Nov 10 ( PTI ) .
Union minister Haribhai Parthibhai Chaudhary has said that the performance of the Modi government should be judged only after its five - year term ends , amid strong criticism by opposition parties over demonetisation and GST .
The minister of state for coal and mines said that adequate time should be given to the central government to work and people should evaluate its performance after that .
" You have to give 12 hours to get curd from milk .
If you check the milk every hour , curd will not form , " he said at the Golden Jubilee celebration of Hindustan Copper Ltd ( HCL ) here yesterday .
His remarks came in the wake of strong criticism of the government by the opposition , which alleged that the BJP - led Union government has failed to bring " achhe din " as promised by the party during its 2014 general election campaign .
The opposition parties have also slammed the government for abruptly demonetising high - value currency in November last year and on Goods and Services Tax implementation this year .
The Union minister acknowledged that there could be some short - term hitches due to the two government decisions , but added that the moves will yield huge benefits in the long - run .
Signalling to the constraints of the previous coalition government , he said alliance partners did not allow the central government to be decisive in the past , but the BJP government has taken more than 800 decisions in its three years .
Chaudhary said India will emerge as a powerful country by 2024 .
All villages would have electricity by 2019 , he added .
The minister urged the employees of public sector units to serve the country through their work and contribute to the profitability of the PSUs .
He said HCL's plan to quadruple production was in sync with Modi's ' Make in India ' initiative .
HCL CMD Santosh Sharma said the company was implementing mine expansion schemes to quadruple its production from 3.4 million tonnes to 12.4 million tonnes per annum in five years at an estimated capital expenditure of around USD 700 million .
This will help India to reduce copper import which stands at 90 per cent of the domestic consumption , he said .
Prez Kovind's kin fails to get BJP ticket , to contest as Ind
Lucknow , Nov 10 ( PTI ) .
Failing to get a BJP ticket for the local body elections , President Ram Nath Kovind's niece - in - law has filed her nomination as an Independent in Jhinjhak in Uttar Pradesh's Kanpur Dehat district .
Deepa Kovind was keen on contesting for the post of chairperson of the Jhinjhak Nagar Palika Parishad but did not find favour with the BJP's local unit , members of her family said .
Deepa is the wife of President Kovind's nephew Pankaj , the son of his elder brother Pyarelal , and lives in Jhinjhak .
The local BJP unit , which chose another woman for the seat , said it will try and accommodate her in the party organisation .
" Deepa Kovind had sought a ticket for the Jhinjhak Nagar Palika Parishad chairman's post .
But a survey at the local level found that another woman , Sarojani Devi , enjoyed the support of the people and she was given the ticket , " said Rahuldev Agnihotri , district unit president of the BJP in Kanpur Dehat .
He also said the BJP does not indulge in family politics .
Has anyone , he asked , seen seen a family member of Prime Minister Narendra Modi enter the electoral fray .
Describing the president as the pride of the district , he said , " We are talking to Deepa's family members so that she withdraws from the fray . . . she will be accommodated in the party organisation . "
Giving his side of the picture , Deepa's husband Pankaj said he met the district unit president as well as the local MLA seeking a ticket for his wife .
" The former said it will be given to someone who is educated and will be a dedicated party worker . "
To the family's surprise , Pankaj said , the ticket was given to a woman who was earlier with the BSP and not as educated as his wife , who holds a postgraduate degree .
The Kovind family , he added , had long been associated with the BJP and is well known .
When their repeated requests yielded no result , they consulted their supporters and people from the area and took the decision that Deepa would contest as an Independent , he said .
" She will definitely win , " Pankaj asserted .
Deepa's brother - in - law Deepak , who is her election manager , echoed him and added that she will not withdraw her nomination .
" She is getting wide support from the people , " he said .
President Kovind belongs to Paurakh village of Kanpur Dehat .
His family resides in Jhinjhak where elections are slated for November 29 .

OYO launches Home Management Service to unlock second homes
Mumbai , Nov 10 ( PTI ) .
OYO today announced the launch of Home Management Service that aims to utilise the company's existing on - ground operations to deliver a hassle - free solution to second home - owners .
Piloted in December 2016 , the team will focus on locked and unused homes across top holiday destinations in the country , OYO said in a release .
It is already managing over 300 private homes including villas , apartments , bungalows and farmhouses in five cities .
" India's top holiday destinations have a sizable number of homes that are locked and unutilised .
Homeowners are unable to put these assets to personal or commercial use due to lack of time and - or expertise in home stay - management .
We saw this as an untapped opportunity where our business has existing synergies , " OYO Chief Growth Officer Kavikrut said .
He said there is significant market opportunity especially as people have invested in second homes in top holiday destinations across India .
" In Goa , the supply of housing has increased by 25 per cent between 2001 to 2011 , while the population increased by 8 per cent in the same period .
The 2011 census shows that 85,000 residential units remained unoccupied out of the total 5.76 lakh houses on record , " he said .
The vacancy rates have increased by 62 per cent since the last census and home owners are unable to utilise these assets because there is no trusted maintenance and management partner , he added .

BCCI rejects NADA demand of testing Indian cricketers
New Delhi , Nov 10 ( PTI ) .
In a stern response to India's anti - doping body NADA , the BCCI has said that government body has no jurisdiction to conduct dopes tests on Indian cricketers .
In a letter written on November 8 to NADA chief Navin Agarwal , BCCI CEO Rahul Johri made it clear that there is no requirement for NADA to tests its cricketers since the board is not a National Sports Federation ( NSF ) and its present anti - doping system is robust enough .
" It is relevant to mention here that BCCI is not a National Sports Federation .
Accordingly , NADA does not have jurisdiction to conduct dope testing of Indian cricketers in any domestic or international event organised or under the aegis of BCCI , " Johri wrote in the letter .
" In light of the aforesaid , there is no requirement for any BCCI official to co - ordinate with NADA for dope testing of Indian cricketers either during competitions or out of completions . "
The BCCI response was prepared with instructions from Supreme Court - appointed Committee of Administrators .
Besides responding to the NADA chief , Johri also wrote back to the sports secretary , who had approached the BCCI in October to cooperate with NADA .
The Ministry had stated that lack of co - operation from BCCI on the subject may run the risk of NADA not complying with World Anti - Doping Agency ( WADA ) Code .
Johri said BCCI's existing anti - doping mechanism is robust enough .
" The BCCI already has a robust dope testing mechanism which is employed for both during competitions and out - of - competitions and the testing of samples by IDTM is already being done at WADA accredited laboratory ( NDTL ) under aegis of the Sports Ministry . "
He further claimed that the BCCI is compliant with the WADA Code .
" You will appreciate that for analysis and testing of samples , BCCI adheres to the WADA International Standard of Laboratories and the WADA International Standard for Testing and Investigations .
" Accordingly , the BCCI has engaged the services of same expert sample collection agency that is also engaged by the ICC to prove sample collection services viz , International Doping Tests and Management ( IDTM ) .
" The IDTM sends the collected samples for testing to a WADA accredited laboratory viz , National Dope Testing Laboratory ( NDTL ) , as mandated by WADA .
Since the CEO of NDTL is sports secretary , the dope testing for BCCI is conducted under the aegis of the Sports Ministry , " wrote Johri .
He further reasoned that since BCCI is an autonomous body affiliated to the International Cricket Council ( ICC ) , it is only required to operate within the rules and regulations of the ICC .

New Delhi , Nov 10 ( PTI ) .
Gold prices went up Rs 80 to Rs 30,530 per 10 grams today , comforted by a positive global trend , along with increased buying by local jewellers to meet ongoing wedding season demand .
In contrast , silver slumped Rs 125 to Rs 40,575 per kg , driven down by reduced demand from industrial units .
Apart from the firm trend overseas , traders said , local gold jewellers intensified their buying at the domestic spot market , which mainly led to the rise in prices .
Globally , gold rose 0.21 per cent to trade at almost a 3 - week high of USD 1,283.50 an ounce in New York yesterday amid uncertainty over US tax reforms .
In the national capital , gold of 99.9 per cent and 99.5 per cent purity moved up by Rs 80 each to Rs 30,530 and Rs 30,380 per 10 grams , respectively .

Trump says US will no longer be taken advantage of on trade
Danang ( Vietnam ) , Nov 10 ( AP ) Hours after leaving Beijing , President Donald Trump today delivered what appeared to be a sharp rebuke to China , railing against trade practices he says have put Americans out of work and warning that the US would no longer " turn a blind eye " to trade abuses .
" From this day forward we will compete on a fair and equal basis , " Trump told a gathering of CEOs on the sidelines of the annual Asia - Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Vietnam .
" We are not going to let the United States be taken advantage of anymore .
I am always going to put America first . "
It was a striking change of tone from the day before , when Trump had set aside his previous blistering rhetoric in favour of friendly overtures to China as he sought to establish a more balanced trade relationship .
But today , Trump was back to blunt .
He told the executives gathered in the coastal city of Danang that he was happy to enter into bilateral trading agreements , but only if they are reciprocal and fair .
Without singling out China by name , Trump argued the US had adhered to World Trade Organization principles , only to be taken advantage of by counties that had ignored the rules and engaged in harmful practices such as product dumping , currency manipulation and government subsidising of goods .
" Such practices , along with our collective failure to respond to them , hurt many people in our country , " Trump said , describing " jobs , factories and industries " he said were " stripped out of the United States and out of many countries " as a result .
" We can no longer tolerate these chronic trade abuses and we will not tolerate them , " he said .
In the speech , Trump said he had spoken " openly and directly " with Chinese President Xi Jinping during his visit about " about China's unfair trade practices and the enormous trade deficits they have produced with the United States . "
Trump said China's trade surplus , which stood at USD 223 billion for the first 10 months of the year , was unacceptable , and repeated his language from yesterday when he said he did " not blame China " or any other country " for taking advantage of the United States on trade . "
But Trump went on to say that the US would " no longer turn a blind eye to violations , cheating or economic aggression . "
" We will no longer tolerate the audacious theft of intellectual property .
We will confront the destructive practices of forcing businesses to surrender their technology to the state and forcing them into joint ventures in exchange for market access .
We will address the massive subsidizing of industries through colossal state - owned enterprises that put private competitors out of business , all the time , " he said .
All are allegations the US has lodged against China .
Trump also continued to talk tough against North Korea and its development of nuclear and ballistic missiles weapons , as he has throughout the trip .
" The future of this region and its beautiful people must not be held hostage to a dictator's twisted fantasies of violent conquest and nuclear blackmail , " he said .
Trump referenced his address earlier this week in South Korea when he called on countries to unite against North Korea .
He said " every single step the North Korea regime takes toward more weapons is a step it takes into greater and greater danger . "
APEC is the first of several summits Trump is scheduled to attend on his first official visit to Asia .
It will be a change in pace the president , who has spent much of the week basking in elaborate welcome ceremonies and banquets , and meeting with the leaders of Japan , South Korea and China .
His schedule for Friday includes an official welcome event for world lead leaders attending the summit and their spouses , along with a gala dinner and cultural performance , before formal talks begin tomorrow .

Panaji , Nov 10 ( PTI ) .
Amid the growing concerns over air pollution , the Goa government is planning to encourage people to use bicycles to move around in the state's capital city .
In this regard , it is planning to tie - up with a private company for operating bicycles , fitted with the Global Positioning System ( GPS ) , on rent .
Parrikar said the environment - friendly conditions cannot not be created overnight in the state and the people will have to work for it .
" We are ? encouraging buses running on bio - fuel .

In the same way , the best way to reduce it ( pollution ) further is to use a bicycle , " he said .
" You can use a bicycle to go to the market .
What we have done is we are tying - up with a firm for operating bicycles .
We will only give them places where the bicycles can be parked , " the chief minister said .
The bicycles would be fitted with the GPS and the user will have to register with the company to hire it , he said .

Cheating case : HC grants anticipatory bail to Pune builder
Mumbai , Nov 10 ( PTI ) .
The Bombay High Court today granted interim protection from arrest to Pune - based real estate developer D S Kulkarni and his wife in an alleged cheating case .
Justice A S Gadkari passed the order while hearing the anticipatory bail pleas filed by D S Kulkarni , the owner of DSK Builders , and his wife Hemanti Kulkarni .
The couple approached the high court after a sessions court in Pune rejected their pleas for their anticipatory bail applications .
The Economic Offences Wing ( EOW ) of the Pune police had lodged a case last month against the company and the couple for allegedly cheating around 1,350 depositors , who claimed that they did not get back their investments amounting to about Rs 50 crore .
The high court today said it would hear the pleas on November 17 .
" Interim protection from arrest is granted till then , " Justice Gadkari said .
After scores of complaints , the EOW had last week conducted searches at DSK's offices and residence and wrote to the banks to freeze the group's 70 accounts .
They had also written to various agencies such as SEBI , ED and sub - registrar offices .
For the past several months , all these investors , largely pensioners , were queueing up at the DSK's office here .
As many as 170 depositors , who invested in the Fixed Deposit ( FD ) scheme of the DSK group , had approached the Pune Police a couple of months ago , demanding that a cheating case be registered against the firm .
According to police , a senior citizen , Jitendra Mulekar ( 65 ) had last month complained to the police claiming to have invested Rs 4,40,647 in the scheme .
The investor alleged that he neither received the principal amount nor the interest since February 2017 .

Musharraf forms ' grand alliance ' of 23 political parties
Islamabad , Nov 11 ( PTI ) .
Pakistan's former dictator Pervez Musharraf has formed a " grand alliance " of 23 political parties , according to media reports .
The grand alliance named Pakistan Awami Ittehad ( PAI ) will be headed by 74 - year - old Musharraf , while Iqbal Dar has been appointed as Secretary General .
Addressing media persons through video conferencing from Dubai , the former president said all parties representing Muhajir ( migrant ) community should be united , local media reported .
He invited the Muttahida Qaumi Movement ( MQM ) and the Pak Sarzameen Party ( PSP ) to join the new political alliance .
About the nature of alliance , he said all the member parties will contest together with one name .
Musharraf denied reports that he was going to head the MQM , claiming that it was " ridiculous " to think that he would want to be head of a " minor , ethnic party " .
" MQM - Pakistan is merely half of what the ( original ) party used to be , " he said .
" I am concerned about ( the internal problems ) of the party ; however , I have no interest in replacing Farooq Sattar or Mustafa Kamal even if their parties are united , " he insisted .
Criticising MQM , he said that the party and the muhajir community have lost respect .
" The muhajir community would do better to abandon ethnic politics and join PAI , " he said .
He expressed hope that Pakistan Muslim League - Quaid leaders Chaudhry Shujaat and Chaudhry Pervez Elahi would join his grand alliance as well .
The former president also advised Pakistan Tehhreek - i - Insaf ( PTI ) chairman Imran Khan to " join hands with a group that would take Pakistan forward " while accusing him of only thinking about his own party .
Musharraf thanked the alliance for appointing him as the chairman and announced that he would return to Pakistan soon , adding that he did not want any security when he does since the country's situation is better now .
Musharraf had left the country for Dubai in March last year after the interior ministry issued a notification to remove his name from the exit control list ( ECL ) .
He said he will return at the " appropriate time " so that the " development work in the country is not disturbed " .
Musharraf , who was charged with treason by a special court last year and was declared an absconder in the Benazir Bhutto murder case in August this year , claimed that he was ready to face all charges as the courts are not under " Nawaz Sharif's control anymore " .
" The accountability process should not be affected by my arrival ( to Pakistan ) , " the former president said , adding that the courts and the armed forces must be " allowed " to function as both institutions are working in the country's favour .

Missing girl case : HC warns of action against cops
Mumbai , Nov 11 ( PTI ) .
Taking a strict note of the Mumbai Police's failure to find a minor girl who was reported missing from the city five years ago , the Bombay High Court said that if the police department does not straighten its act soon , it will not hesitate in initiating punitive action against it .
A bench of justices S C Dharamadhikari and Bharati Dangre recently dismissed the police's submission that it made all possible efforts to trace the girl and finally concluded that it was " impossible " to find her .
The bench questioned why the police failed to make inquiries at " construction sites , domestic help agencies , fishing trawlers , illegal distilleries , automobile garages , etc , " for those were often the places where most children who are kidnapped or lost invariably end up at . "
" The police machinery folds its hands and says it is impossible to trace the child .
They say , we have done everything that is permissible and possible at our end .
The report filed does not indicate that all out efforts are made , " the bench observed .
" No construction sites , illegal distilleries , garages have been raided .
We as citizens find cars being washed , houses and utensils being cleaned , babies being looked after , all by children employed as helpers or domestic workers all around us .
" We do not see how police machinery does not notice all this .
Several of these children could be the subjects of the missing complaints lodged with the police , " the bench said .
The bench also dismissed the police's submission that its success rate of tracing missing children had improved from " 66 per cent to 89 per cent since June this year , " saying that as long as there existed cases like the present , any statistical achievement was of no use .
The police filed a report in high court stating that the success rate in investigating cases of missing persons in entire Konkan region has improved .
The report stated that while until June , such rate was only 66 per cent , between June and September this year , " positive progress was made in the probe of 115 of the 129 cases of missing persons . "
The court however said it wanted to know how many more such cases will it have to intervene in , before the police takes more earnest steps .
While it granted the police time till November 30 as a last chance to trace the girl , it said it was " up to the police now to take the matter in the right earnest , " else , the court will be constrained to pass strictures .
" We will also not hesitate to direct the home ministry or the director general of police to transfer or remove such officials who are irresponsible , and whose inability in investigating such cases tarnishes the image of the entire police machinery .
We will not hesitate to take action ourselves in such cases , " the bench said .
The court was hearing a plea filed by the mother of the missing girl .
As per the plea , the girl was eight - year - old when she had gone missing in 2012 .
The police initially suspected that she was kidnapped by neighbours following a tiff , but it failed to make any progress in its probe since then .

HPCL corruption case : Special CBI court acquits two
Mumbai , Nov 11 ( PTI ) .
A special CBI court here has acquitted two persons in a corruption case , citing lack of evidence and the prosecution's failure to prove the charges .
Special judge P S Tarare recently acquitted a former convener of the Oil Sector Officers Association ( OSOA ) , Ashok Singh , and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited ( HPCL ) executive Shishir Kumar Dubey .
The CBI had filed the charge sheet against Singh , who was then Chief Regional Manager at HPCL's Vashi Regional Office , and station manager Dubey for allegedly manipulating petrol pump meter readings and misappropriating funds between 2004 and 2007 .
The CBI in its charge sheet filed in 2010 stated that Dubey allegedly entered into a criminal conspiracy with Singh to misappropriate funds by " manipulating dip readings resulting in reporting of lower stock loss and mismatch between derived sales quantities and nozzle sales " .
The charge sheet had also said that the two allegedly misused the fleet cards facility by not collecting amount in cash from select customers .
The CBI contended that Dubey in connivance with Singh manipulated Management Information System ( MIS ) to misappropriate funds and extend unauthorised discounts .
They extended unauthorised credit of over Rs 44.04 crore to 45 parties , resulting in loss of Rs 88.09 lakh to HPCL , the agency had said .
However , Dubey's lawyer informed the court that as per the statutory inspection report , there was no manipulation .
" This report is prepared by the area sales manager and he did not report any anomaly , " said Dubey's lawyer Ninad Mazumdar .
He claimed that the company ignored the statutory report and made its own report , using a wrong formula .

Akhtar , Johar support Bhansali's ' Padmavati ' amid controversy
New Delhi , Nov 11 ( PTI ) .
Veteran lyricist Javed Akhtar and filmmaker Karan Johar have come out in support of Sanjay Leela Bhansali as he faces trouble ahead of the release of his magnum opus " Padmavati " , saying films are just a mode of expression and they should not be misinterpreted as history .
Various groups , most of them from the Rajput community , have accused Bhansali of " distorting " historical facts in the film which features Deepika Padukone , Shahid Kapoor and Ranveer Singh .
During a session at Sahitya Aaj Tak , Akhtar was asked about the controversy surrounding the movie , and the lyricist said , " I was listening to a history professor on TV who said that there is a difference of 200 - 250 years between Khilji's rule and the writing of ' Padmavat ' .
There was no mention of Padmavati before Malik Muhammad Jayasi wrote the ' Padmavat ' .
" A lot of history has been written about that time .
There are a lot of records available of that time but there is no mention of Padmavati in them . "
Citing the example of Ashutosh Gowariker's " Jodha Akbar " , Akhtar said as per the history Akbar never had a wife by the name of Jodha Bai and people should not confuse a work of fiction with history .
" Stories get created .
Don't misinterpret films for history and history for films .
You watch cinema and enjoy it .
If you are interested in history , then read it seriously , " he added .
Johar , whose last directorial venture " Ae Dil Hai Mushkil " , featuring Pakistani actor Fawad Khan and Imran Abbas , had a hard time in getting a smooth release , was also present at the event .
The filmmaker said he respects Bhansali's vision and the fact that his " beautiful film " is caught up in the controversy makes him feel bad .
" I have faced a lot of controversies before the release of a film .
I feel bad for a filmmaker , who is one of the best in the country .
Sanjay Leela Bhansali has made a beautiful film and I hope he is protected by the people who understand that creativity is a form of expression .
" He has himself said that he has made a film which is true to the story and there is nothing in it that might hurt the sentiments and sensibilities of people .
I think we should trust and believe him and give this film all the love , " Johar said .
" Padmavati " , which is scheduled to release on December 1 has been facing a lot of trouble since early this year .
Bhansali was assaulted by activists of a Rajput community group , Karni Sena , while shooting in Jaipur .
The group has been constantly seeking ban on the release of the film , which they claim is distorting the history .
Yesterday , hundreds of people associated with various community organisations also took out a march in Thane demanding a ban on the film .
Bhansali had earlier said that the film is his tribute to the " sacrifice , valour and honour " of Rani Padmavati .
He has also said there is nothing in the film that will hurt anyone's sentiments and sensibilities .

NGT clears odd - even scheme with riders , trims exemptions
New Delhi , Nov 11 ( PTI ) .
The National Green Tribunal today gave a conditional nod to the AAP government's decision to implement the odd - even car rationing scheme for five days from November 13 , ordering that no exemption should be allowed to " any person or officer and two - wheelers " .
The NGT said that the odd - even scheme should be implemented " without any default " as and when PM ( particulate matter ) 10 level goes above 500 microgrammes per cubic metre and PM 2.5 level crosses the limit of 300 microgrammes per cubic metre during a span of 48 hours .
A bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Swatanter Kumar ordered that there should be no exemption to " any person or officer and two - wheelers " from the ambit and scope of the road rationing scheme and would be applied with equal vigour to all vehicles .
Earlier , the government announced exemptions for women drivers , two - wheelers and vehicles carrying children in school uniforms , besides VVIPs .
Today's decision came after the Central Pollution Control Board ( CPCB ) and the Delhi Pollution Control Committee ( DPCC ) told the bench that two - wheelers were more polluting than other vehicles , and emissions from motorbikes accounted for 20 per cent of the total vehicular pollution .
However , the tribunal exempted CNG vehicles , emergency services such as ambulance and fire , and vehicles carrying waste .
" The Delhi government would be free to declare the odd - even scheme strictly subject to conditions .
In terms of the environment ministry's notification order and Graded Response Action Plan as and when PM 10 and 2.5 cross levels of 500 and 300 microgrammes per cubic metre respectively , it shall be mandatory for the Delhi government to implement the scheme without any default , " the bench said .
Taking strong exception to the decision to increase parking fees in Delhi by four times , the NGT ordered the Delhi government and the authorities concerned to reconsider the decision .
The tribunal said , " The hike in parking fees will only benefit the contractors and would stress people by encouraging them to park vehicles on the roads instead , choking them in the process . "
" The extra money collected would not come to the government for sure .
You are only enriching the contractors through the order , " it said .
While passing a slew of directives , the NGT said every entry point to Delhi should be properly managed by the city government , the corporations should ensure that there was no congestion , and neighbouring states such as Uttar Pradesh and Haryana should depute special forces at the border of the national capital to avoid traffic jams .
" All the private transporters who have been granted permit by the Delhi government shall provide vehicles to carry essentials in coordination with the Delhi Transport Corporation as part of their corporate social responsibility .
" Since it is commonly agreed that sprinkling of water is a substantial solution for decreasing the pollutant level in the air , the same shall be done without default in future and in the coming week unless it rains , " the bench said .
The bench also issued notices to the National Highway Authority of India ( NHAI ) and the National Buildings Construction Corporation ( NBCC ) to show cause why exemplary cost should not be imposed on them and the erring officials be imprisoned for violation of its order putting a ban on construction activities .
It constituted a team of officials from the CPCB and DPCC , and the special secretary of environment department of the Delhi government , which would collect data of ambient air quality and analyse all different parameters including PM levels , carbon monoxide , sulphur dioxide etc .
" All the samples are to be analysed in the CPCB laboratory and at the IIT Delhi , " it said .
The tribunal took note of thermal power plants operating around Delhi and said there were 30 plants producing 11,000 megawatt of power which are one of the biggest factors for contribution to the pollution as they contribute 80 per cent sulphate and 50 per cent nitrate which add to the air pollution .
" If emissions from these plants are controlled or are upgraded with technology it could largely impact the pollution condition in Delhi , " the NGT said .
During the two - hour hearing , the Delhi government came under a scathing attack from the tribunal which asked the AAP dispensation why it did not introduce odd - even car rationing scheme earlier this month when the air quality was worse .
The NGT bench also came down heavily on the city government's decision to exempt some categories of people from the odd - even scheme and enhance parking fees to control pollution , terming it as " absurd " .
" Why didn't you introduce odd - even earlier when air quality was worse ?
Measures such as enhanced parking fees to decrease pollution are absurd , " the bench asked .
The tribunal also questioned the government if the decision to introduce the odd - even scheme was taken with the consent of the Lieutenant Governor .
" Is odd - even scheme at the whim and thought of a particular officer or the Delhi govt as a whole .
Is it being implemented with the consent of both the Lieutenant Governor and Delhi government , " it asked .
The car - rationing scheme , which was enforced twice in the national capital in 2016 , will be in place between November 13 and 17 from 8 am to 8 pm .
Under the policy , private vehicles are allowed to run based on the last number of their licence plates .
Odd - numbered cars are allowed to run on odd dates while even - numbered cars can only run on even dates .

Aizawl , Nov 11 ( PTI ) .

Cong says credit for GST rate cuts goes to Rahul Gandhi
New Delhi , Nov 11 ( PTI ) .
The Congress today claimed credit for the the GST Council's decision to cut tax rates on 178 items of daily use , saying the government was forced to do so due to the pressure mounted by party vice - president Rahul Gandhi and the " huge response " his campaign had been receiving in poll - bound Gujarat .
Leading the charge against the government on the Goods and Services Tax ( GST ) , Gandhi said the Congress would continue to fight for a 18 - per cent cap on the highest GST slab instead of the current 28 per cent , and vowed that the party would get the job done " if the ruling BJP doesn't " .
He also reiterated that India needed a simple tax and not the " Gabbar Singh Tax " as he had been describing the tax regime to target the Modi government .
Congress general secretary in - charge of Gujarat , Ashok Gehlot told PTI that the GST Council yesterday decided to cut the tax rates due to the pressure mounted by Gandhi and the " huge response " he had been receiving in the poll - bound western state .
Gujarat , the home state of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP president Amit Shah , has been under the BJP's rule for over two decades and the Congress is trying to oust it from power .
Congress leaders , particularly Gandhi , have made the GST and demonetisation as key issues of their campaign .
Gehlot claimed the GST Council brought about the changes in tax rates with an eye on votes in Gujarat .
The state goes to poll in two phases on December 9 and December 14 .
" It ( BJP ) is rankled by trepidation that Gujarat will slip off its hands .
That's why the rates were cut .
The Council did so because of the pressure Rahulji mounted and response his yatras in the state are getting , " he said .
Congress's chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala termed the GST Council's move " installment - based tinkering " which he said underscored the " chaos within and adhocism " of the BJP - led central government .
Accusing Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and the government of " paying lip service and creating havoc " , Surjewala said the Congress was determined to make the tax regime " flawless " .
" India needs a simple tax , not Gabbar Singh Tax .
The Congress and people have got 28 per cent tax abolished on several items fighting for it .
Our fight for 18 per cent cap with one rate will continue .
If the BJP doesn't do it , the Congress will , " Gandhi tweeted .
Surjewala demanded that petroleum products , real estate and electricity be brought under the ambit of the GST .
He also called for reducing " compliance burden " of the GST and added that the textile sector was faced with deep stress due to " distorted duty structure " .
" Adjournment and deferment , rather than decision , appear to be the ' way forward ' for this government .
" None of these challenges have been addressed by the Council .
This is owing to the sheer ineptitude and amateurish handling of the biggest tax reform by BJP the government , " he added .
Congress leader Pawan Khera said that the credit should be given to Gandhi .
" There was a pressure from Rahul Gandhi .
The Gabbar Singh Tax went so much viral in Gujarat that the BJP did not know how to deal with it , " Khera said .
He , however , added that much more needed to be done to extend the relief to the farming community as the central excise on fertilisers was 1.03 per cent before GST , but after the new taxation system came into force , the tax was increased to 5 per cent .
He said that the tax on agricultural equipment such as tractor was as high as 18 per cent .
The GST Council yesterday decided to reduce tax rate on items ranging from chewing gums to detergents - - to 18 per cent from current 28 per cent
The all - powerful council pruned the list of items attracting the top 28 per cent tax rate to just 50 from 228 previously .
The GST , implemented from July 1 , has five tax slabs of 0 per cent , 5 per cent , 12 per cent , 18 per cent and 28 per cent .

Bengal mulls fish farming in cages
Kolkata , Nov 13 ( PTI ) .
The West Bengal Fisheries department has decided to initiate farming of fishes in cages across the state to meet the burgeoning local demand and also to cut down dependence on neighbouring states for supplies , a senior official has said .
" We have decided to initiate the fish cage culture system or cage aquaculture across West Bengal , " the official of the state Fisheries department told PTI .
For the purpose , brackish water bodies owned by the State Fisheries Development Corporation ( SFDC ) as well as by fishery cooperatives and private owners would be used , the official said .
" Similar fish cage culture has been done by private organisations , but on much smaller scales .
We are planning to come up with this on a much bigger scale , " he said ,
Cage aquaculture is a fish farming procedure on a floating frame .
It involves growing of fishes in existing water resources while being enclosed in a net cage which allows free flow of water .
They can be installed in reservoirs , rivers , lakes or sea .
A catwalk and handrail is also built around the floating cages .
Circular cages of different diameter , ranging from 2m to 15m , designed for cage culture would be engaged for the purpose where varieties like milkfish , mullet , pearl spot , shellfishes such as shrimps , crabs and lobsters are on the list , he added .
" These days cage culture is receiving attention from both researchers and commercial producers .
Several small and limited resource farmers are looking forward to it as alternatives to traditional agricultural crops because aquaculture appears to be a rapidly expanding industry .
We are hopeful that this will be a hit among small farmers , " he said .
The official added that cage aquaculture can play a significant role in increasing the overall fish production in West Bengal .
Since , the investment is low , this farming method is ideal for small scale fishermen and farmers as an alternative source of income .
As per the initial plans of the Fisheries department , 80 cages would be employed for the cultivation .
" Initially there will be 80 cages used for the cultivation of fishes .
Out of these , 18 cages will be used by the SFDC and the rest will be distributed among those in the districts of East Midnapore , both North and South 24 Parganas who will be employed for the cage culture of fishes , " the official said .
Depending on the success of the venture in commercial terms , the Fisheries department has plans to start similar activities in freshwater bodies and in marine areas .
With 2.10 lakh hectares , West Bengal is considered to have one of the country's largest impounded brackish water area after Odisha , Gujarat and Kerala .

Armoured vehicles were seen on the streets near the Zimbabwean capital Harare as questions mounted today over whether President Robert Mugabe , who has ruled since independence from Britain in 1980 , still has a firm grip on power .
Tensions between the 93 - year - old leader and the military that has been a key buttress to his reign have intensified , and prolonged gunfire erupted near his private residence in the suburb of Borrowdale in the early hours , a witness told AFP .
No further details were available .
Mugabe's ZANU - PF party accused army chief General Constantino Chiwenga on Tuesday of " treasonable conduct " .
The public dispute has presented a major test for Mugabe , who is in increasingly frail health .
Chiwenga had demanded that Mugabe stop purges of senior party figures , including vice president Emmerson Mnangagwa , who was dismissed last week .
ZANU - PF said Chiwenga's stance was " clearly calculated to disturb national peace . . . and suggests treasonable conduct on his part as this was meant to incite insurrection " .
Before being ousted , Mnangagwa had clashed repeatedly with Mugabe's wife Grace , 52 , who is seen as vying with Mnangagwa to be the next president .
As the situation deteriorated overnight , the US embassy in Harare warned its citizens in the country to " shelter in place " due to " ongoing political uncertainty " .
The armoured vehicles spotted outside Harare alarmed many residents as Chiwenga had warned of possible military intervention .
The army's spokesman was not available to comment .
" I saw a long convoy of military vehicles , " a female fruit seller told AFP , while other witnesses took to social media to confirm the reports .
Mugabe is the world's oldest head of state , but his poor health has fuelled a bitter succession battle as potential replacements jockey for position .
Some of the army top brass are seen as strongly opposed to Grace Mugabe's apparent emergence as the likely next president .
" We very rarely see tanks on the roads , " Derek Matyszak , an analyst at the Pretoria - based Institute for Security Studies , told AFP .
" Chiwenga threw down the gauntlet to Mugabe . . . it would make sense for Chiwenga to organise some military manoeuvres to up the ante .
" It's clear we are entering new territory here . "
In speeches this year , Mugabe has often slurred his words , mumbled and paused for long periods .
His lengthy rule has been marked by brutal repression of dissent , mass emigration , vote - rigging and economic collapse since land reforms in 2000 .
The main opposition MDC party called for civilian rule to be protected .
" No one wants to see a coup . . .
If the army takes over that will be undesirable .
It will bring democracy to a halt , " shadow defence minister Gift Chimanikire , told AFP .
ZANU - PF's influential youth league , which supports Grace Mugabe as the next president , said in a statement that army chief Chiwenga must not be allowed to choose Zimbabwe's leaders .
Speculation has been rife in Harare that Mugabe could seek to remove Chiwenga , who is seen as an ally of ousted Mnangagwa .
The crisis marks an " ominous moment in the ongoing race to succeed " Mugabe , said political analyst Alex Magaisa in an online article .
" ( Mugabe ) has previously warned the military to stay away from ZANU - PF's succession race .
" His authority over the military has never been tested in this way . "
Mnangagwa , 75 , was widely viewed as Mugabe's most loyal lieutenant , having worked alongside him for decades .
He fled the country and is thought to be in South Africa after issuing a searing five - page condemnation of Grace's ambition and Mugabe's leadership .
Earlier this year the country was gripped by a bizarre spat between Grace and Mnangagwa that included an alleged ice - cream poisoning incident that laid bare the pair's rivalry .
Mnangagwa took over as vice president from Joice Mujuru who was axed in 2014 after Grace Mugabe launched a campaign accusing her of plotting to topple the president .
Grace Mugabe - - 41 years younger than her husband - - has become increasingly active in public life in what many say is a process to help her eventually take the top job .

Four killed in California mass shooting
Los Angeles , Nov 15 ( AFP ) .
Four people were killed and nearly a dozen wounded , including two children , when a gunman went on a rampage , randomly picking his targets at a school and other locations in rural northern California .
Tehama County Assistant Sheriff Phil Johnston told reporters that the assailant was killed by police following the mass shooting , which began around 8 : 00 am ( local time ) at a home in Rancho Tehama Reserve and continued at several locations in the community , including the elementary school .
He said no children were among the dead and the motive for the assault was unclear , although it may be linked to a domestic dispute and a history of disagreements with neighbors .
" It was very clear at the onset that we had an individual that was randomly picking targets , " Johnston said at a news conference .
" This man was very , very intent on completing what he set out to do today . "
He said one child was shot and wounded at the school .
Another suffered non - life - threatening injuries while riding in a car with his mother , who was severely wounded .
Johnston said the gunman , who has not been identified , went on his shooting spree after stealing a neighbor's vehicle and then tried to gain access to the school but was unsuccessful as it was on lockdown .
He said the suspect , who was wearing a military - style vest , left the school to continue on his rampage and crashed the vehicle at one point .
He then stole a second vehicle and was killed in a shootout with police .
One of the four victims was a woman the gunman had previously been accused of stabbing , Johnston said .
Rancho Tehama resident Salvador Tello , who was taking his three children to school , described seeing the gunman open fire , killing a woman .
Tello " said he saw bullets strike the truck in front of him and he put his children down to protect them and put his truck to . . . reverse , " Redding Record Searchlight newspaper reporter Jim Schultz said on Twitter .
" As he left , he saw ( a ) woman lying dead in the street and her . . . wounded husband next to her .
Was told help was on its way . "
Another witness , Casey Burnett , said the gunman was " driving around and shooting randomly from his car . "
Area resident Brian Flint told local media that his roommate had been shot and killed by the gunman .
" He's dead .
He didn't make it , " Flint told KCRA , referring to his roommate .
" For his family and everything , I feel bad , and we'll be there for them . "
He said the gunman was a neighbor and had " been shooting a lot of bullets lately , hundreds of rounds , large magazines . "
The shooting coincides with a flareup of the long - running debate on America's epidemic of gun violence and the ready accessibility of high - powered weapons , less than 10 days after a gunman shot dead 26 people at a church in Texas .
Johnston told reporters that three weapons - - a semi - automatic rifle and two handguns - - had been recovered from the scene .
He added that some 100 law enforcement officers responded to the shooting .
The Redding Record Searchlight said among the wounded was a six - year - old who suffered two gunshot wounds and another child shot in the leg .
The elementary school is located on the outskirts of Corning , an olive oil - producing town of around 8,000 people about 100 miles ( 160 kilometers ) north of the state capital Sacramento .
Jason Wandel , chief division counsel at the FBI's Sacramento field office , told AFP that agents had been sent to help with the investigation .
More than 33,000 people die annually in the United States from gun - related deaths - - two thirds of them suicides - - according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .

People fear losing property to ' Mission Green Mahanadi '
Kendrapara ( Odisha ) , Nov 15 ( PTI ) .
Villagers living along river banks in Kendrapara and Jagatsinghpur districts fear losing their cattle grazing fields and burial grounds to the state's new plantation drive ' Mission Green Mahanadi ' .
The project , estimated to cost Rs 200 crore , aims at planting over two crore saplings along the banks of Mahanadi and its tributaries to arrest soil erosion and improve bio - diversity .
The government's announcement had initially elicited positive reactions from people in the riverside villages .
But the fear of losing out on their community utility land has now made some of them skeptical about the project .
" The project would definitely check soil erosion and help recharge ground water .
The river embankments would receive a natural buffer .
In the long run , it will be immensely beneficial to people living in flood - prone areas , " said Zilla Parishad member Ganesh Chandra Samal .
The residents of Tikapanga village in Kendrapara , however , want the government to protect their utility land before implementing the project .
" We welcome the plantation project .
At the same time we don't want to lose the village cremation ground or the grazing fields .
The government officials should provide an alternative land before the drive gets underway , " a Tikapanga village resident said on the condition of anonymity .
The farmers in the catchment areas reap bumper crops every year .
Vegetable cultivation is also abundantly done in these plots after paddy cultivation .
" The landowners should be duly compensated ( if they lose their plots ) , " Kanhu Charan Ojha of Gadaramita village in Kendrapara said .
People living in the catchment areas of Jahanpur village in Jagatsinghpur district shared similar apprehensions .
While the massive plantation drive would go a long way in checking soil erosion and strengthening embankments in flood - prone areas along the river , areas like cremation ground would be lost in the process , said Mahendra Biswal , a resident of Jahanpur .
Therefore , the government should take necessary steps for making available land for community utility purpose , he said .
Compensation should also be provided to farmers who are likely to be affected by the project , Biswal said .
The project is being implemented in view of the larger interest of people in flood - prone villages .
The government would definitely look into the complaints of local people , if there was one , said Jagatsinghpur Collector Yamini Sadangi .
The first phase of the plantation drive would be undertaken on 200 sq km stretch in 2018 - 19 , said a forest official .
Court frames money laundering charges against Shabir Shah , Aslam Wani
New Delhi , Nov 15 ( PTI ) .
A Delhi court today framed money laundering charges against Kashmiri separatist leader Shabir Shah and alleged hawala dealer Mohammad Aslam Wani in a 2005 case of alleged terror financing .
Additional Sessions Judge Sidharth Sharma framed the charges to which both the accused pleaded not guilty and claimed trial .
The Enforcement Directorate had on September 23 filed the charge sheet against Shah accusing him being in touch with Pakistan - based terrorist Hafiz Saeed .
The charge sheet also named Wani , who is in judicial custody along with Shah .
The court had taken cognisance of the over 700 - page charge sheet which relied upon 19 witnesses .
The central probe agency , in the charge sheet filed under sections of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act ( PMLA ) , had furnished Shah's statements where he has allegedly told the investigators that he has " no source of income of his own " and that he does " not file any Income Tax Return ( ITR ) . "
The probe agency had recorded the statement of 36 - year old Wani where he allegedly said that he came to Delhi from Srinagar " at the directions of Shah " sometime in April , 2003 and that was the first time he had met him .
Wani was arrested by the ED on August 6 from Srinagar .
The ED alleged that Wani was asked by Shah to " work for him ( on a commission basis ) in collecting hawala money from Delhi and deliver to him at Srinagar . "
The case dates back to August 2005 in which the Delhi Police's Special Cell had earlier arrested Wani .
Wani had then claimed that he had given Rs 2.25 crore to Shah , following which the ED had registered a criminal case under PMLA against the duo in 2007 .
Wani was arrested with Rs 63 lakh , allegedly received through ' hawala ' channels from the Middle East , and a cache of ammunition , on August 26 , 2005 .
During questioning , he had allegedly told the police that Rs 50 lakh was to be delivered to Shah and Rs 10 lakh to Jaish - e - Mohammad area commander in Srinagar , Abu Baqar , and that the rest was his commission .
In 2010 , a Delhi court had cleared Wani of terror funding charges but had convicted him under the Arms Act .
Court rejects godman's plea for pre - arrest bail
Thane , Nov 15 ( PTI ) .
A local court has rejected the anticipatory bail application of a 60 - year - old self - styled ' godman ' , accused of raping a woman and swindling her by promising to cure her ailing father .
District and Additional Sessions Judge A S Bhaisare rejected the application of the godman , who was booked by the Thane Police under IPC sections pertaining to rape , cheating , criminal intimidation and provisions of the Black Magic Act and the IT Act .
According to the prosecution , the investigating officer in the case told the court that the accused got in touch with the 39 - year - old woman , a resident of Thane city and working as a senior executive with a private company , on a social networking site in June 2015 when she was looking for treatment of cancer of her ailing father .
The accused , who ran an ashram at Guwahati in Assam , came to Thane and allegedly convinced her of his supernatural powers .
He charged the woman's family Rs 3 lakh for various rituals to " cure " cancer , said the officer .
He claimed that she was his wife in previous birth and took her to various places , including in Assam and Delhi , where he allegedly raped her repeatedly , the investigating officer informed the court .
The accused also allegedly filmed the woman and blackmailed her into submission , he told the court .
The woman filed the complaint against the accused in June this year with the Thane Police .
The man filed the anticipatory bail application on November 6 .
The accused's counsel submitted that his client was known to the woman and that their sexual relations were consensual and hence , he has not committed any offence .
The prosecution , however , told the court that the accused had taken over Rs 3 lakh from the complainant .
He had three wives and children and cheated the complainant , the prosecution further said .
The court perused the case diary and after hearing both sides , rejected the anticipatory bail application of the accused on November 8 .
Meanwhile , the police have launched a search for the accused .

Moody's ups India rating , says reforms will spur sustainable growth
New Delhi , Nov 17 ( PTI ) .
The US - based Moody's today upgraded India's sovereign credit rating by a notch to ' Baa2 ' with a stable outlook citing improved growth prospects driven by economic and institutional reforms .
The rating upgrade comes after a gap of 13 years - Moody's had ? last upgraded India's rating to ' Baa3 ' in 2004 .
In 2015 , the rating outlook was changed to ' positive ' from ' stable ' .
The ' Baa3 ' rating was the ? lowest investment grade - - just a notch above ' junk ' status .
" The decision to upgrade the ratings is underpinned by Moody's expectation that continued progress on economic and institutional reforms will , over time , enhance India's high growth potential and its large and stable financing base for government debt and will likely contribute to a gradual decline in the general government debt burden over the medium term , " Moody ? s said in a statement .
Sovereign rating is a barometer of the country's investment climate .
It gives investors insight into the level of risks associated with investing in a particular country and also includes political risks .
For long , India was rated by other rating agencies at Baa3 , the lowest investment grade and just a notch above the junk grade , which has now been upgraded a notch higher by Moody's .
The Narendra Modi government has been pitching for an upgrade for quite some time now citing various reforms initiatives .
The upgrade comes days after India climbed 30 places to rank 100th on the World Bank's Doing Business Report .
The stock market and the rupee reacted positively with a sharp rally today .
The global ratings agency , however , cautioned that high debt burden remains a constraint on the country's credit profile .
" Moody's believes that the reforms put in place have reduced the risk of a sharp increase in debt , even in potential downside scenarios , " it said .
Moody's Investors Service upgraded the Government of India's local and foreign currency issuer ratings to ' Baa2 ' from ' Baa3 ' and changed the outlook on the rating to stable from positive , the statement said .
Stating that reforms will foster sustainable growth prospects , the US - based agency said the government is mid - way through a wide - ranging programme of economic and institutional reforms .
" While a number of important reforms remain at the design phase , Moody's believes that those implemented to - date will advance the government's objective of improving the business climate , enhancing productivity , stimulating foreign and domestic investment , and ultimately fostering strong and sustainable growth , " Moody ? s said .
The reforms programme will thus complement the existing " shock - absorbance capacity " provided by India's strong growth potential and improving global competitiveness , it added .
Reforms like the Goods and Services Tax ( GST ) will promote productivity by removing barriers to inter - state trade .
Also , improvements to the monetary policy framework , measures to address the overhang of non - performing loans ( NPLs ) in the banking system and those like demonetisation , the Aadhaar system of biometric accounts , and targeted delivery of benefits through the Direct Benefit Transfer ( DBT ) system are intended to reduce informality in the economy .
Other important measures which have yet to reach fruition include planned land and labour market reforms , which rely to a great extent on cooperation with and between the states , it said .
" Most of these measures will take time for their impact to be seen , and some such as the GST and demonetisation have undermined growth over the near term , " it added .
Moody's expects GDP growth to moderate to 6.7 per cent in the fiscal year ending in March 2018 .
However , as disruption fades , assisted by recent government measures to support SMEs and exporters with GST compliance , real GDP growth will rise to 7.5 per cent next fiscal , with similarly robust levels of growth from 2018 - 19 onwards .
" Longer term , India's growth potential is significantly higher than most other Baa - rated sovereigns , " Moody ? s noted .
Moody's had ? last upgraded India's rating to ' Baa3 ' in 2004 .
Democracy is safe in India because of Hindus : Giriraj Singh
Bhopal , Nov 16 ( PTI ) .

Hope other agencies follow suit to up India rating : CEA
New Delhi , Nov 17 ( PTI ) .
Top government officials today hailed the rating upgrade by Moody's as " long overdue " and hoped others such as S & P and Fitch will follow suit as it presses ahead with steps to ratchet up growth .
The US - based Moody's today upgraded India's sovereign rating after 13 years to Baa2 with a stable outlook , from Baa3 earlier .
" It's a welcome development , but we also feel it was long overdue . . . it's a recognition of the actions that the government has undertaken like GST , bankruptcy .
We also need to keep all these things in perspective , " Chief Economic Adviser Arvind Subramanian said .
The government , he said , " is going to do what it has to do on domestic front - - employment growth , economic growth , reviving investment , " he told reporters here .
Asked if he expects other agencies like S & P and Fitch to upgrade , he said : " Let's hope they are not inconsistent amongst each other . "
Subramanian had earlier observed that rating agencies follow inconsistent policies while rating India and China .
Economic Affairs Secretary Subhash Chandra Garg said the upgrade is definitely a big vindication of the structural and institutional reforms that India is doing .
" The fiscal deficit consolidation , debt control and all so everything which the government has done in the past couple of years have been recognised .
They are projecting a little rise in the trajectory going forward , so they are conscious of the real dynamics of the debt situation .
We , of course , remain committed to the fiscal path , " Garg said .
Asked if the government will keep in mind the rating while reviewing fiscal deficit target next month , Subramanian said : " Government policies are dictated by what we have to do in terms of our own objectives , macroeconomic reforms and reviving growth . "
Finance Secretary Hasmukh Adhia also said the path that the government has chosen for long - term reforms and fiscal consolidation is well recognised by investors already .
" The rating agency too has now confirmed it formally , which is welcome , " Adhia tweeted .
According to Subramanian , the upgrade is a recognition of reforms like GST , the bank recapitalisation plan , the bankruptcy code and macroeconomic stability .

New Delhi , Nov 17 ( PTI ) .
The Supreme Court today asked all states and Union territories to consider prohibiting the use of pet coke and furnace oil by industries , saying it was a cause of pollution not only for the National Capital Region ( NCR ) but the entire nation .
The apex court , which has already banned the use of pet coke and furnace oil from November 1 in Uttar Pradesh , Haryana and Rajasthan , made the remarks after the Centre said the Central Pollution Control Board ( CPCB ) has issued a direction on their prohibition with immediate effect until further orders .
" We may note that pollution caused by pet coke and furnace oil is not a problem confined only to the NCR region but appears to be a problem faced by almost all the states and Union territories in the country , " a bench comprising justices Madan B Lokur and Deepak Gupta said .
" For the present , we do not propose to give any direction to any other state and Union territory but we request all the state governments and Union territories to consider taking similar measures as have been taken by the Government of India and the chairman of the Central Pollution Control Board under section 5 of the Environment ( Protection ) Act , 1986 , " it said .
The apex court had on November 13 reserved its order on various applications filed by industries , using pet coke and furnace oil in these three states , seeking some relaxation in the ban order .
Additional Solicitor General A N S Nadkarni , representing the Ministry of Environment , Forests and Climate Change , told the bench that the government had taken a decision on November 15 and asked the CPCB to issue a direction prohibiting use of pet coke and furnace oil by industries in these three states .
He made it clear that the ban was with respect to the entire state and not applicable to the NCR only .
During the hearing , an advocate , who has been appointed as an amicus curiae to assist the court in the matter , said that a direction should be issued that there was a ban on sale of pet coke and furnace oil for being used as fuel in these three states .
Nadkarni told the bench that he would look into this aspect and get back to the court within a week .
The bench has fixed the matter for hearing on December 4 .
The court had on October 24 banned the use of pet coke and furnace oil in these three states from November 1 while keeping in view the pollution levels in Delhi - NCR and noting that these states had no objection to it .
The use of pet coke and furnace oil is already prohibited in Delhi .
The court was hearing a PIL filed in 1985 by environmentalist M C Mehta who had raised the issue of air pollution in the Delhi - NCR .
Climate talks wrap up with progress on Paris rulebook
Bonn ( Germany ) , Nov 17 ( AP ) Global talks on curbing climate change wrapped up today , with delegates and observers claiming progress on several key details of the 2015 Paris accord .
The two - week negotiations focused on a range of issues including transparency , financial assistance for poor nations and how to keep raising countries ' targets for cutting carbon emissions .
" We are making good progress on the Paris agreement work program , and we are on track to complete that work by the deadline , " Fijian Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama told diplomats hours before the meeting in Bonn , Germany , was due to conclude .
Bainimarama , who presided over the talks , faced the challenging task of reconciling the often conflicting positions of rich and poor countries , especially when it comes to what each side needs to do to curb climate change .
Signatories of the Paris agreement want to keep global warming significantly below 2 degrees Celsius by the end of the century .
That goal won't be achieved unless countries make further efforts to sharply reduce carbon emissions caused mainly by the burning of fossil fuels .
Observers say the US delegation played a largely constructive role during the talks , despite the Trump administration's threat to pull out of the Paris accord .
While one group of American officials led by White House adviser George David Banks raised eyebrows by hosting a pro - coal event during the talks , a second group consisting of seasoned U.S . negotiators quietly got on with the painstaking job of refining the international climate rulebook , said Elliot Diringer , a veteran of such UN meetings .
" It's a smaller team but a strong team , " said Diringer , who is the executive vice president of the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions , a Washington think tank .
" From all accounts they have been playing a constructive role in the room advancing largely the same positions as before . "
Environmental groups voiced disappointment at German Chancellor Angela Merkel's failure to announce a deadline for her country to stop using coal , a major source of carbon emissions , even as other nations such as Canada and Britain committed to a phase - out .
Leadership hopes are now being pinned on President Emmanuel Macron of France , who is hosting a climate summit in Paris next month to mark the second anniversary of the landmark accord .
Further low - level talks will take place over the next year in order to present leaders with final drafts for approval at the next climate meeting in Katowice , Poland , next year .

Reacting to Tharoor's remarks , Irani yesterday tweeted , " Did all the Maharajs ( kings ) kneel in front of the British ?

DDA's record in securing its lands appalling : HC
New Delhi , Nov 18 ( PTI ) .
Terming the record of the DDA in securing lands acquired by it " appalling " , the Delhi High Court has directed creation of a unit for evolving land management policies and clear encroachments on public land .
The direction was issued to the Delhi Development Authority ( DDA ) , the Delhi government and the Centre by a bench of Justices S Ravindra Bhat and S P Garg , which said the team or cell should be given statutory status and be manned by high ranking officers .
The court said the Centre shall consider the feasibility of creating such a body with its personnel .
" This unit or cell , in the opinion of the court , should continuously monitor the land management policies of DDA and ensure that wherever needed , court orders are implemented and also oversee all other relevant aspects , " the bench said .
The directions by the court came while disposing of a 12 - year - old PIL that the DDA was unable to secure its land in Delhi and that a large extent of up to 42,000 acres was either encroached or not taken possession of .
The bench said that " the long , 12 - year saga of this case has revealed that DDA's record in securing lands acquired by it and in taking over possession as well as in ensuring them to be encroachment free , has been appalling " .
It said there was never any clarity about the total extent of land acquired by the authority and what was indeed in its possession .
" Even as on date , precise details are not forthcoming , readily , " the bench noted .
It said that acquisition proceedings are undertaken at considerable public expense and cost with a view of executing a planned public project , but before the project can start the acquired land is encroached upon .
As a result , the DDA or the agency concerned was " unable to execute the project in a timely manner " and in some cases it " cannot progress and is impeded to a great extent " , the bench said .
Zimbabweans to march as Mugabe's future in the balance
Harare , Nov 18 ( AFP ) .
Zimbabwe was set for more political turmoil today with protests planned as veterans of the independence war , activists and ruling party leaders called publicly for President Robert Mugabe to be forced from office .
The marches will cap an unprecedented week in which generals seized power and put Mugabe under house arrest in a stunning turnaround for the president who has ruled since 1980 .
The 93 - year - old autocrat did not resign in talks with the army chief on Thursday and sources suggested the veteran leader was " buying time " to negotiate an end to his 37 year reign .
Mugabe appeared publicly for the first time at a pre - planned graduation ceremony in Harare on Friday , further stoking questions over the status of his discussions with General Constantino Chiwenga , who led the military power grab .
Later in the day , eight of Mugabe's ruling party's 10 regional branches took to state television to call for him to go .
Cornelius Mupereri , a spokesman for ZANU - PF's Midlands region , was one of several party barons to appear on ZBC's nightly news to read almost identical statements calling on Mugabe to quit .
Chris Mutsvangwa , chairman of the independence war veterans ' association , said " the game is up " for Mugabe and announced street protests against the president .
" It's done , it's finished . . .
The generals have done a fantastic job , " he said at a press conference in Harare .
" We want to restore our pride and ( Saturday ) is the day . . . we can finish the job which the army started . "
The veterans ' association supports ousted vice president Emmerson Mnangagwa - - whose sacking sparked the army intervention on Tuesday .
They are organising a gathering at a large sports field in a working class suburb on the outskirts of Harare .
It was the location of Mugabe's first speech after returning from exile in Mozambique in 1979 .
Demonstrators had begun to arrive in the area by midnight local time .
The US embassy in Harare warned its citizens to avoid another protest - - thought to be a pro - Mugabe counter - demonstration - - expected to take place in Robert Mugabe Square in the centre of the capital .
Other demonstrations are expected elsewhere in the country today .

Chennai , Nov 17 ( PTI ) .
The Madras High Court ? today directed the Tamil Nadu government to constitute a special police team led by a deputy superintendent of police to investigate an incident of alleged firing on two fishermen by the Indian Cost Guard .
A bench of Chief Justice Indira Banerjee and Justice M Sundar gave the order while admitting a PIL by ' Fisherman Care ' , an association of fishermen .
According to the petitioner , ? on November 13 , when five fishermen from the state were fishing at about four nautical miles from Olaikuda near Rameshwaram , a coast guard patrol ship opened fire at them at around ? 3.15 pm .
One person sustained injuries in the attack , the petition said .
The coast guard personnel also allegedly seized the vessel of the fishermen , the petitioner claimed .
" The Indian Coast Guard which was formed to protect Indian fishermen and assist them in distress has opened fire at the innocent fishermen while they were fishing in Indian waters and indulged in inhuman acts , " the petitioner alleged .
The petitioner wanted the court to constitute a special investigation team or to direct an independent agency to probe the issue .
Two fishermen were injured after being hit by a stray bullet allegedly fired during a training exercise by the Coast Guard personnel in the sea off Rameswaram .
The Coast Guard , however , denied the incident .
TNCA , Madras Race Club move HC over rent arrear demand
Chennai , Nov 17 ( PTI ) .
The Tamil Nadu Cricket Association ( TNCA ) and the Madras Race Club ( MRC ) have moved the Madras High court challenging huge rental arrear demands raised by revenue authorities for lands leased to them in the city and subsequent freezing of their bank accounts .
In separate petitions , the two bodies submitted that the revenue authorities had revised the lease amount by manifold and raised exorbitant demands as arrears - - Rs 1,553 crore for the TNCA and Rs 310 crore for the MRC .
They also realised some money from the bank accounts of the two under the Revenue Recovery Act toward the arrears .
The petitions came up before different judges who passed interim orders giving partial relief .
Justice K Ravichandrabaabu , admitting the petition by the TNCA , restrained the authorities from realising any further amount from the bank accounts of the association over the Rs 1,553 crores rental arrears till further orders .
The demand notice was issued by the Mylapore - Triplicane Tahsildar on ? September 11 , demanding rental arrears from 2001 for the land on which the M A Chidambaram Cricket Stadium was situated here .
The judge posted the matter to ? November 21 ? for further hearing .
When the petition by the MRC came up for hearing , Justice M Duraiswamy permitted the club to operate one of the five bank accounts frozen to meet its day - to - day expenses and posted the matter to November 21 .
The judge directed that the club shall not draw any further amount from the remaining frozen accounts and not take any coercive steps .
The counsel for the TNCA submitted that authorities had increased the rental amount " suddenly " by 20,713 times compared to the rent paid till 2000 and frozen eight bank accounts of the association .
The petition submitted the TNCA was a non - profit organisation that nurtured talented cricketers and provided world - class facilities for the game with an average annual income of Rs 25 to Rs 30 crore and expenditure of Rs 22 to 23 crore .
The total income generated by it through sponsorships , sale of tickets for matches and share of media rights in the last 86 years of its existence would not come remotely close to the amount demanded , it said .
The land in Chepauk area here was given to the association in 1936 on a 30 - year lease for building a modern stadium and the lease was extended twice later .
In 1995 , the annual rental was fixed at around Rs 50,000 for the first five years of the 20 - year lease period with a provision to enhance the rent for the subsequent period .
Subsequently , in 2004 , authorities fixed the rent at the market value from April , 2000 and demanded Rs 22.98 crore .
The petition said the tahsildar has issued a demand notice seeking Rs 1,553 crore and sought to quash it .
The MRC in its petition said the club was assigned 160.86 acres of land for a lease period of 99 years on a yearly rent of Rs 614.13 in March , 1946 which was valid till 2044 .
The amount was paid in advance for the entire lease period .
It contended that no right was given to either party to revisit the rent determined in the lease deed dated March 8 , 1946 .
The land was developed as a world class race course .
However , in December 1970 , the government enhanced the rent by 14 per cent and raised a demand for Rs 310.70 crore as the revised rent for July 1974 to June 2004 , which is already under legal challenge .
In June last year , the tahsildars of Velacherry and Guindy , where the race course properties are located , issued demand notices again .
Consequently , penal proceedings were initiated and by the November 14 last order bank accounts frozen , the club said .
The counsel for the MRC submitted that since the bank accounts were frozen , it was not in a position to meet the day - to - day expenditure for maintaining and feeding the race horses and ponies numbering 700 and running the club .
The petition sought to quash all the proceedings and to restrain the authorities concerned from interfering with the smooth functioning of the club .
HC direction to Centre on transgenders bill
Chennai , Nov 17 ( PTI ) .
Voicing concern over the plight of transgenders , the Madras High Court today directed the Centre to inform it whether a follow up action would be taken to make the transgender bill pending in the parliament a statute .
Giving the direction on a petition filed by two trangenders , Justice N Kirubakaran said a decision on the passage of the bill should be taken at the earliest because the transgenders were suffering .
He directed the central government that it has to inform the court whether the follow up action would be taken to make the Transgender Persons ( Protection of Rights ) Bill 2016 a statute .
He noted that the Lok Sabha referred the bill to the parliamentary standing committee on social justice and empowerment on September 12 , 2016 , for examination and the committee submitted its report on July 21 this year .
" They ( transgenders ) are unable to even use public facilities like washroom for their convenience .
If any right is given under the proposed act , it will definitely address this problem also , " the judge said .
The judge also directed the Centre to inform the court why it introduced its own bill in the Lok Sabha when already a private member bill " The Rights of Transgender Persons Bill , 2014 " was passed unanimously by the Rajya Sabha on April 24 , 2015 , and subsequently came to the lower House .
He was referring to a submission by the counsel for the Centre in this regard .
Taking a serious view of the Tamil Nadu government's failure in implementing the court's earlier direction on reservation to transgenders , the judge said a decision shall be taken on or before November 27 failing which the health secretary , and the secretary , Social Welfare Department have to appear in the court .
A bench of the high court had directed the state government to take a decision on the reservation for the transgenders within six months .
" The period of six months has already expired and even today it is stated that the decision is being considered , " he noted in his order .
They could not postpone the issue of making reservation to transgenders indefinitely , the judge said .

Amritsar , Nov 18 ( PTI ) .
The BSF has seized 22 kg of drugs , suspected to be heroin , after an ambush with cross - border drug smugglers along the India - Pakistan border in Punjab early today , official sources said .
They said 22 packets , containing 1 kg of drugs each , a Turkey - made pistol , 11 bullets and a 12 - feet plastic pipe have been seized by the BSF personnel from along the border fence near the Satpal post in Firozpur sector .
The ambush was a result of joint intelligence report of the BSF and the Punjab police .
Officials said some movements were noticed along the border fence around 4 am and when the BSF troops challenged the miscreants gunfire was exchanged .

Cement bag costs Rs 8000 at this border town in Arunachal
Itanagar , Nov 14 , ( PTI ) .
: Believe it or not , people living in Vijoynagar town of Arunachal Pradesh pay Rs 8,000 for one bag of cement , that too if it is available .
Vijoynagar , a sub - divisional town under Changlang district with just 1500 residents , has no proper surface communication .
People have to walk for five days from the nearest thoroughfare in Miao to reach the town .
Though there is a weekly helicopter service for transporting supplies but that is largely subjected to weather condition .
" People in this town , mostly inhabited by Chakmas and Hajongs , charge Rs 8,000 for a bag of cement and flat Rs 2,000 for WC pan , " Public Health Engineering department junior engineer Jumli Ado told PTI .
The PHE department is undertaking construction of Individual Household Latrine ( IHHL ) in the town , a project partially funded by Centre - Rs 10,800 from the central government and Rs 9,200 by the state for one IHHL .
" All materials are transported to Vijoynagar , at the India - China - Myanmar tri - junction , through Namdapha National Park by Chakmas .
They charge Rs 8,000 per bag of cement ( Rs 150 per kg ) , " Ado disclosed .
They carry those materials physically and walk down 156 km for five days to reach the destination , Ado said , adding one could imagine the challenges this hilly state faces in achieving the open defecation free ( ODF ) status by December .
Ado , while taking part in Swachh Bharat Abhiyan - Gramin ( SBA - gramin ) awareness programme at Namphainong village of the district on November 4 , had said despite numerous challenges IHHL project is moving at a fast pace .
State Civil Supply Minister Kamlung Mossang , who represents Miao assembly constituency , said the state government has approved a road construction project for the area .
Bordumsa village ( headman ) Shekhep and ODF consultant Nyabon Pongtey added that journey to Vijoynagar by foot is a herculean task .
Development naturally moves at a snail's speed in this part of the state , they said .
" Union Minister of State for Home Kiren Rijiju had announced in Itanagar in July 2014 a central government proposal to populate nearly 100 villages situated along the border .
Though Arunachal shares international boundary of 1,680 km with Bhutan , China and Myanmar , the the project has not seen the light of the day , " Shekhep lamented .
Development is still a mirage in this sensitive border state for lack of connectivity even after three decades of establishment .
Many of the inhabited villages in far - flung areas are inaccessible and deprived of essential commodities .
The North Eastern Frontier Agency ( NEFA ) , largest among seven NE states , was created in 1954 .
It became a union territory and was renamed Arunachal Pradesh on January 20 , 1972 and finally statehood on February 20 , 1987 .
The Central Purchase Organization ( CPO ) with base at Mohanbari in Assam's Dibrugarh district , now known as the public distribution system ( PDS ) , was very effective in the 80s when essential items were airdropped in many remote areas .
With the PDS proving ineffective , today salt which costs Rs 20 per kg in state capital is about Rs 250 in many border areas , including Vijoynagar .
" People living in the border areas are forced to migrate to urban places for lack of basic amenities .
These ghost towns along the border are one of the reasons why China is entering the territory , " former finance minister Late Kalikho Pul had told a tribal ministers ' conference in New Delhi on October 28 , 2014 .
Believe it or not , people living in Vijoynagar town of Arunachal Pradesh pay Rs 8,000 for one bag of cement , that too if it is available .
Complaint against Farooq Abdullah , Rishi Kapoor over PoK remark
Jammu , Nov 18 ( PTI ) .
A social activist has filed a complaint with the district magistrate against former chief minister Farooq Abdullah and actor Rishi Kapoor seeking registration of sedition cases against them for their remarks on Pakistan Occupied Kashmir ( PoK ) .
Sukesh Khajuria , a former member of the prominent citizen's advisory committee constituted by the state government , in an application yesterday sought action under section 196 of the CrPC against them for " accepting PoK as part of Pakistan " .
In the application , he said they should be booked under section 124 - A of the Ranbir Penal Code ( Sedition ) and other provisions of law .
On November 11 , Abdullah had told reporters that PoK belonged to Pakistan and " this won't change " no matter how many wars India and Pakistan fight .
In his complaint , Khajuria said Kapoor had backed Abdullah and tweeted that " Jammu and Kashmir is ours , and PoK is theirs .
This is the only way we can solve our problem " .
He alleged that Abdullah's statement and Kapoor's tweet were " inciting violence " and " public disorder " and fell under the ambit of section 124 - A of the RPC .
Nothing to celebrate Moody's rating : Yechury
Kolkata , Nov 17 ( PTI ) .
CPI ( M ) general - secretary Sitaram Yechury said today there was nothing to celebrate about the Moody's upgrading India's sovereign credit rating as the country " lags " behind in all parameters of other global indices .
He also criticised the Narendra Modi - led government for delaying the winter session of the parliament and said these were the " signs " that it was not willing to face the House .
" The government is trying to represent the upgradation of India's ranking by Moody's rating agency as a sign of progress .
But what is this rating all about ?
This rating tells us in which country the industrialists and investors will have more profit , " he said at a party programme here .
" More profit to investors mean more oppression of working class and this cannot be a reason to celebrate .
India has turned into a junior partner of US imperialism , " he said .
The country , he said , " lags " behind other nations , even Bangladesh , in various global indices of growth such as education , eradication of hunger , poverty and employment .
Moody's Investors Service today raised India's sovereign rating for the first time in more than 13 years and said that growth prospects of the country have improved with continued economic and institutional reforms .
The US - based agency upped India's rating to Baa2 from Baa3 , changing outlook to ' stable ' from ' positive ' and said that reforms will help stabilise rising levels of debt .
Yechury alleged that the Modi government is trying to evade the " uneasy questions " that it is likely to face in the parliament over the various corruption charges ahead of the Gujarat assembly poll .
" The BJP government is trying to implement its model where it will not want to face the Parliament and its proceedings .
It is very well aware that it will face uneasy questions in Parliament on various issues of corruption .
They feel that the proceedings of the Parliament will have an impact on the upcoming assembly election in Gujarat , where the BJP is not in a very good situation , " the CPI - M leader said .
Amid suggestions that the winter session of the parliament will be a truncated affair , Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad yesterday said the Cabinet Committee on Parliamentary Affairs will take a call on the issue .
Yechury accused the ruling TMC in Bengal and the BJP of being engaged in " competitive communalism " in order to reap political benefits .
" The TMC is pursuing the politics of appeasement of minorities and the BJP is trying to fan majority communalism .
In this way both are helping each other to grow .
" Actually , both the parties are hand in gloves with each other as their main enemy is CPI ( M ) , who they know will never allow commnal politics in the state , " the Left leader said .

Mumbai , Nov 18 ( PTI ) .
Cities like Mumbai and Pune have to bear the burden of urbanisation and migration from across the country and hence the police machinery will have to develop innovative skills to deal with law and order problems , the Bombay High Court has said .
The remarks were made by a division bench of Justices S C Dharmadhikari and Bharati Dhanger while hearing a petition filed by a man here after the police reportedly failed to find his daughter who has been missing ever since her husband committed suicide in 2014 .
The court , last week , observed that it was high time that the investigating machinery establishes its own mechanism and obtains information about missing persons .
Noting that cities like Mumbai and Pune have to bear the burden of urbanisation and migration from all over India , the court said , " The police machinery will have to develop innovative skills to deal with law and order problems . "
" Nobody can stop influx of people to these cities .
It is not possible to control the activities of all those who are residing and those who are newly entering these places .
Hence , it is for the police machinery to meet these challenges , " the court observed .
The bench noted that police officials must give up their habit of awaiting for leads and clues from the complainant and look for other leads and clues .
The court said a coordination has to be established with the Railway , Civic and State Government authorities , non - governmental organisations ( NGOs ) and citizens so that the police machinery will have regular information about missing persons , criminals and absconders .
" Website of police stations would have to be updated and as and when information about persons stated to be missing is obtained .
The same should be displayed on the website so that all concerned , including those related to them can approach the police station and give further useful information , " the court said .
The bench posted the petition for further hearing on November 23 and directed the police to file their affidavit in reply .

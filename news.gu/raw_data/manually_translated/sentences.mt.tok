Degree of separation always exists when adapting a book : Joshi	(vNQxkV0_1_title)
Panaji , Nov 23 ( PTI ) .	(vNQxkV0_1_1)
Poet - lyricist Prasoon Joshi believes it is impossible to bring the exact vision of the author on the big screen while adapting a work of literature .	(vNQxkV0_1_2)
Joshi , who is also the chairman of the Central Board of Film Certification ( CBFC ) , said when a writer pens a book he is putting forward his imagination , but if a film is made with his work as a source there is huge possibility of it being different from what the author originally perceived .	(vNQxkV0_1_3)
" When a writer's book is interpreted on screen , there is definitely a degree of separation in that .	(vNQxkV0_1_4)
There is a scriptwriter , a dialogue writer , and then there is music playing different role in that interpretation .	(vNQxkV0_1_5)
" When there are so many people interpreting a writer's work , there is a huge possibility that it will be different from what the writer imagined at the first place , " Joshi said during a panel discussion on the sidelines of International Film Festival of India ( IFFI ) .	(vNQxkV0_1_6)
He said the two creations co - exist and it does not mean that the book is superior or the film is inferior .	(vNQxkV0_1_7)
The National Award - winning lyricist said an author would never be satisfied with the interpretation of his work .	(vNQxkV0_1_8)
" He will always feel that cinema didn't understand his vision .	(vNQxkV0_1_9)
But the truth is , it is impossible to adapt any piece of literature exactly on screen .	(vNQxkV0_1_10)
Only spirituality can make everyone understand the same feeling what writer had while writing his work . "	(vNQxkV0_1_11)
Joshi , who has films like " Bhaag Milkha Bhaag " and " Rang De Basanti " to his credit as a writer , said for him what matters is the " intent " behind the interpretation .	(vNQxkV0_1_12)
" Whenever I have collaborated as a writer , there has always been a difference between what I imagined and what comes out .	(vNQxkV0_1_13)
When I write a song and the musician has composed , it is also different .	(vNQxkV0_1_14)
" Like ' Rang De Basanti ' , I remember I told A R Rahman that I am writing a recipe to make ' basanti ' colour .	(vNQxkV0_1_15)
I actually wrote the song like a recipe and I sent it to Rahman and then he composed it .	(vNQxkV0_1_16)
It was a completely different interpretation .	(vNQxkV0_1_17)
But the only thing I have learned amid all this is ' what was the intent ? '	(vNQxkV0_1_18)
If the intent is correct , everything is perfect , " he said .	(vNQxkV0_1_19)
Joshi said many authors and poets have made a switch to cinema because there was a dearth of people interested in literature .	(vNQxkV0_1_20)

The Sahara Group had earlier sought 18 months to repay around Rs 9,000 crore balance of the principal amount of Rs 24,000 crore .	(GNQ-fjh_1_7)
The apex court had on October 12 taken strong exception to the alleged obstruction by the Sahara Group in the Aamby Valley auctioning process and warned that anybody creating any impediment would be liable for contempt and " sent to jail " .	(GNQ-fjh_1_8)
The top court was irked when SEBI had claimed that the group had allegedly obstructed the aunctioning process by writing a letter to the Pune police raising the issue of law and order at the prime property .	(GNQ-fjh_1_9)
Taking note of SEBI's allegation , the court had said that the group could not have entered into a communication with Pune's Superintendent of the Police ( Rural ) on the issue since the auction has been ordered by the top court .	(GNQ-fjh_1_10)
The SEBI had alleged that the police has taken custody of the property due to which no bidder was willing to take part in the auction process .	(GNQ-fjh_1_11)
The SEBI had said that the letter was also sent to the additional chief secretary and no bidder was coming forward to bid for the property as the police , while taking note of the letter , has taken its custody .	(GNQ-fjh_1_12)
The top court was hearing the SEBI's plea seeking contempt action against the Sahara group for allegedly obstructing the auctioning process of Aamby Valley .	(GNQ-fjh_1_13)
In its plea , the SEBI had alleged " wilful and deliberate attempt " on Sahara's part " by adopting a subterfuge to cause interference with the administration of justice , especially in a court directed and monitored auction sale of the Aamby Valley property under various orders of the apex court . "	(GNQ-fjh_1_14)
On August 10 , the apex court had rejected Sahara chief Subrata Roy's plea to put on hold the auction process .	(GNQ-fjh_1_15)
It had said the auction process would proceed as per schedule and if Rs 1,500 crore is paid by Roy in the SEBI - Sahara refund account by September 7 , then it may pass an appropriate order .	(GNQ-fjh_1_16)
Roy , who has spent almost two years in jail , has been on parole since May 6 last year .	(GNQ-fjh_1_17)
The parole was granted the first time to enable him attend his mother's funeral .	(GNQ-fjh_1_18)
It has been extended since then .	(GNQ-fjh_1_19)
Besides Roy , two other directors - - Ravi Shankar Dubey and Ashok Roy Choudhary - - were arrested for failure of the group's two companies - - Sahara India Real Estate Corporation ( SIRECL ) and Sahara Housing Investment Corp Ltd ( SHICL ) - - to comply with the court's August 31 , 2012 order to return Rs 24,000 crore to their investors .

Delhi govt's ' achievements ' in education sector a ' myth ' : Maken	(XNQ_46x_1_title)
New Delhi , Nov 23 ( PTI ) .	(XNQ_46x_1_1)
Congress today challenged Aam Aadmi Party government's claims of achievements in education sector , saying it was a " myth " as not only children were leaving Delhi government schools but also less number of them were passing out .	(XNQ_46x_1_2)
Rubbishing Kejriwal government's claims , Delhi Congress chief Ajay Maken released a report , ' Reality of Delhi government education : An expose ' , in a press conference here .	(XNQ_46x_1_3)
" In past two years , about 98,000 children left Delhi government schools while private ones gained 1.42 lakh more , " he said , citing the report complied by accessing data from documents and websites of CBSE and Delhi government .	(XNQ_46x_1_4)
" The AAP government has patted its back and indulged in photo - ops highlighting achievements in education sector .	(XNQ_46x_1_5)
But its a myth as this report shows , " he told reporters .	(XNQ_46x_1_6)
The Class XII results under the AAP government have been the " worst " in recent times , he alleged .	(XNQ_46x_1_7)
In the last year of Congress regime in Delhi , 2013 - 14 , the total number of students in Delhi government schools who passed Class XII was 1.47 lakh .	(XNQ_46x_1_8)
This number declined to 1.17 lakh ( 2016 ) and further 1.09 lakh in 2017 under the AAP government , Maken claimed in his report .	(XNQ_46x_1_9)
" The number of students appearing in and passing Class XII from government schools fell - 42,296 and 38,489 respectively - in last three years , " he said .	(XNQ_46x_1_10)
The AAP always claim a record increase in the education budget of its government but they never tell the unspent amount , he charged .	(XNQ_46x_1_11)
" In 2015 - 16 , the unspent amount of allocation for education was Rs 1000.73 crore and Rs 981.45 crore in 2016 - 17 , " he claimed .	(XNQ_46x_1_12)
The Delhi Congress chief said that the data compiled by him on Class - X results under AAP government was " poor " , and he will release it later .	(XNQ_46x_1_13)
India most exciting film country in the world : TIFF director	(WNQ_CLz_1_title)
Panaji , Nov 23 ( PTI ) .	(WNQ_CLz_1_1)
Cameron Bailey , the artistic director of the Toronto International Film Festival ( TIFF ) may have travelled across the globe and observed the world cinema closely , but the enthusiasm and attachment that Indian audience show towards movies is something that surprises him every time he visits the country .	(WNQ_CLz_1_2)
Bailey says the fact that people in India are so much inspired by films makes it the " most exciting film country " .	(WNQ_CLz_1_3)
In an interview with PTI , Bailey says , " Everybody in India is into movies .	(WNQ_CLz_1_4)
From custom agent to a normal guy everybody is passionate about movies .	(WNQ_CLz_1_5)
There is no place in the world which gets inspired and entertained by cinema like India . "	(WNQ_CLz_1_6)
The former film critic is also in awe of the kind of work filmmakers are doing here and says that India has a vast diversity of movies being made which excites him the most .	(WNQ_CLz_1_7)
" Not just in terms of different regions or languages , India also has various styles of filmmaking and different kind of voices .	(WNQ_CLz_1_8)
India has the most commercial kind of film styles , but also really challenging and radical voices .	(WNQ_CLz_1_9)
" Filmmakers like Anurag Kashyap are breaking the ground and trying to find a personal space , which is also commercially accessible .	(WNQ_CLz_1_10)
I am also really inspired by the number of new filmmakers coming from India .	(WNQ_CLz_1_11)
Like Rima Das of ' Village Rockstars ' , it is just her second feature and is winning awards all over the globe .	(WNQ_CLz_1_12)
It is a positive sign . "	(WNQ_CLz_1_13)
Bailey , however , believes that the strong hold of domestic productions in India , makes it tough for international markets and even Hollywood films to create their own space here .	(WNQ_CLz_1_14)
" People outside India look at it as a tough market because I think everyone is aware that the domestic market in India is so strong .	(WNQ_CLz_1_15)
It is hard for films that don't come from domestic production to really break through .	(WNQ_CLz_1_16)
" But with streaming services coming to India , it is a great way to introduce people of the country to the diverse content .	(WNQ_CLz_1_17)
People in the industry take India as a market with great potential because Indians go to watch movies more than anyone else does in the world . "	(WNQ_CLz_1_18)
Bailey , who has been visiting India frequently for various film festivals with the ongoing International Film Festival of India ( IFFI ) and the NFDC Film Bazaar being the latest one , says such festivals draw focus towards projects which deserve a bigger platform .	(WNQ_CLz_1_19)
" Film festival can make a lot of difference .	(WNQ_CLz_1_20)
Primarily , they can focus on good films which are being made and then work on buying and selling of the films across the globe .	(WNQ_CLz_1_21)
It draws attentions to a lot of films .	(WNQ_CLz_1_22)
" For us in TIFF the most important thing is the audience , as the filmmakers get to show their films directly to the consumers .	(WNQ_CLz_1_23)
There are more and more films being made all across the globes , markets at festivals make things better for indie filmmakers .	(WNQ_CLz_1_24)
We find some amazing films at the markets in festivals . "	(WNQ_CLz_1_25)
The trend of big banners picking up indie projects and providing them with a theatrical release has been growing lately and Bailey believes the reason for the shift in the focus is the need of freshness in movies .	(WNQ_CLz_1_26)
" If big banners are looking for the most talented filmmakers and the new talent , it is important for them to come to festivals .	(WNQ_CLz_1_27)
Every large industry needs to be refreshed and needs new voices and festivals are the best place to find these enthusiastic voices . "	(WNQ_CLz_1_28)

New Delhi , Nov 23 ( PTI ) .	(JNQ_hp8_1_1)
The Supreme Court today said it wanted the Chhattisgarh government to answer a few questions on the purchase of a AgustaWestland helicopter for VIP use in 2006 - 2007 as it was only concerned whether any " fraud or hanky - panky " was committed .	(JNQ_hp8_1_2)
The top court said it was not questioning the choice of the helicopter made by the state government as it was an executive decision , but wanted it to explain the bid for the chopper .	(JNQ_hp8_1_3)
A bench of Justices A K Goel and U U Lalit said there were few questions which the state government needed to answer and it may order probe only if the court was satisfied that some wrong has been committed .	(JNQ_hp8_1_4)
" You ( state government ) need to answer few questions , like explain the alleged sham bid , why only that particular helicopter , opening of foreign bank account by son of the Chief Minister at the time of bidding process , " the bench said .	(JNQ_hp8_1_5)
" We are only concerned whether there was any fraud or hanky - panky committed on public exchequer .	(JNQ_hp8_1_6)
Nothing more or nothing less , " it said .	(JNQ_hp8_1_7)
The bench said if it found that there was nothing wrong , then it will close the case .	(JNQ_hp8_1_8)
The court was hearing a plea seeking investigation into the alleged irregularities in the purchase of the helicopter and also foreign bank accounts purportedly linked to the son of Chief Minister Raman Singh .	(JNQ_hp8_1_9)
At the outset , advocate Prashant Bhushan , appearing for petitioner NGO Swaraj Abhiyan and leader of opposition and Congress leader T S Singhdeo , said that the documents received under the RTI show that although Bell helicopter was denied bid , the government was still hiring it on rent .	(JNQ_hp8_1_10)
He said the petitioners would like to reply to the affidavit filed by the state government .	(JNQ_hp8_1_11)
Senior advocates Mahesh Jethmalani and Harish Salve , who appeared for the state government , said there was nothing wrong in the bid and at present , 24 AgustaWestland helicopters were flying in the country .	(JNQ_hp8_1_12)
AgustaWestland SpA was an Italian helicopter design and manufacturing company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Finmeccanica SpA , now called Leonardo .	(JNQ_hp8_1_13)
It was formed in July 2000 as an Anglo - Italian multinational company .	(JNQ_hp8_1_14)
" The state government was not satisfied with Eurocopter as on July 14 , 2007 .	(JNQ_hp8_1_15)
It had crashed and two pilots were killed , " Jethmalani said , justifying the bidding process .	(JNQ_hp8_1_16)
He said at that time , the existing helicopter was four years old and incurring huge cost on maintenance and servicing with replacement of its components .	(JNQ_hp8_1_17)
The bench said it trusted the choice of the executive but only wanted to see whether there were any " extraneous reasons " for the particular choice of helicopter .	(JNQ_hp8_1_18)
It asked Bhushan to file a reply on the affidavit and posted the matter for further hearing on January 18 .	(JNQ_hp8_1_19)
At the fag end of hearing , Salve said although they have handed over the government records to the petitioners to enable them file the reply , these documents should not find their way to the media .	(JNQ_hp8_1_20)
Justice Lalit then asked Bhushan to ensure that the documents do not exchange hands .	(JNQ_hp8_1_21)
During the hearing , Attorney General K K Venugopal , who had during the last hearing , raised objections over cabinet file notings filed in the PIL and said if the documents were given by state government under RTI , then he does not wish to press his objections .	(JNQ_hp8_1_22)
" You see all these documents are given under RTI .	(JNQ_hp8_1_23)
Your grievances are now addressed Mr . Attorney General .	(JNQ_hp8_1_24)
This is quiet a transparent government , " the bench said on a lighter note .	(JNQ_hp8_1_25)
The apex court had on November 16 put some searching questions to the state government on the purchase of the Agusta helicopter and directed it to place the original files relating to the deal .	(JNQ_hp8_1_26)
It had asked the state government why a global tender was issued only for the purchase of one AgustaWestland chopper and how the recommendation of then state chief secretary to invite tenders from all the companies was " overturned " .	(JNQ_hp8_1_27)

NKorea claims nuclear statehood with US in missile strike range	(3NSDBCr_1_title)
Seoul , Nov 29 ( AFP ) .	(3NSDBCr_1_1)
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said today his country had achieved full nuclear statehood after successfully testing a new missile capable of hitting anywhere in the United States .	(3NSDBCr_1_2)
The intercontinental ballistic missile ( ICBM ) launch snapped a two - month pause in testing by the North and poses a new challenge to US President Donald Trump who has vowed such a capability " won't happen " .	(3NSDBCr_1_3)
North Korean state television brought out Ri Chun - Hee , a senior broadcaster who only appears for significant developments , to announce the landmark .	(3NSDBCr_1_4)
" Kim Jong Un declared with pride that now we have finally realised the great historic cause of completing the state nuclear force , the cause of building a rocket power , " she said .	(3NSDBCr_1_5)
" The great success in the test - fire of ICBM Hwasong - 15 is a priceless victory won by the great and heroic people of the DPRK , " she said , using the official abbreviated name for North Korea .	(3NSDBCr_1_6)
Wednesday's missile was more sophisticated than any previously tested , state media said .	(3NSDBCr_1_7)
" The ICBM Hwasong - 15 type weaponry system is an intercontinental ballistic rocket tipped with super - large heavy warhead which is capable of striking the whole mainland of the US , " the official news agency KCNA said .	(3NSDBCr_1_8)
Pyongyang said the missile reached an altitude of 4,475 kilometres ( 2,800 miles ) and had splashed down 950 kilometres from its launch site .	(3NSDBCr_1_9)
At least one Western expert said the missile's lofted trajectory suggested an actual range of 13,000 kilometres - - longer than that of any previous test and one that would extend to every major US city .	(3NSDBCr_1_10)
Trump , who recently announced fresh sanctions on Pyongyang and returned it to a US list of state sponsors of terror , was opaque in his immediate response , as the UN Security Council agreed to meet in emergency session .	(3NSDBCr_1_11)
" I will only tell you that we will take care of it , " Trump said at the White House .	(3NSDBCr_1_12)
" It is a situation that we will handle , " he added , without elaborating .	(3NSDBCr_1_13)
US Secretary of State , Rex Tillerson , stressed that diplomatic options to resolving the crisis remained " viable and open . "	(3NSDBCr_1_14)
But North Korea's immediate neighbours were less restrained , with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe calling the test an intolerable , " violent " act and South Korean President Moon Jae - In condemning Pyongyang's " reckless " behaviour .	(3NSDBCr_1_15)
It was the first missile test of any kind since September 15 , and quashed speculation that the North may have held back in order to open the door to a negotiated solution to the nuclear standoff .	(3NSDBCr_1_16)
US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said it marked a significant step toward North Korea building missiles that can " threaten everywhere in the world , basically . "	(3NSDBCr_1_17)
Trump insisted there would be no change to his administration's " maximum pressure campaign " which has sought to curb Pyongyang's nuclear weapons programme with tightened sanctions backed by dire warnings of massive retaliation in the event of any attack .	(3NSDBCr_1_18)
It was the North's third successful ICBM test and David Wright , an arms control expert and co - director at the Union of Concerned Scientists , said the flight parameters pointed to a " significantly longer " range than previous launches .	(3NSDBCr_1_19)
" Such a missile would have more than enough range to reach Washington DC , and in fact any part of the continental United States , " he said .	(3NSDBCr_1_20)
While Pyongyang has yet to prove its mastery of the re - entry technology required to bring a warhead back through the Earth's atmosphere , experts believe it is at least on the threshold of developing a working intercontinental nuclear strike capability .	(3NSDBCr_1_21)
" We don't have to like it , but we're going to have to learn to live with North Korea's ability to target the United States with nuclear weapons , " said Jeffrey Lewis , head of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the Middlebury Institute of Strategic Studies .	(3NSDBCr_1_22)
Tensions over the North's weapons programme peaked after Pyongyang conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear test in September and then fired an intermediate - range missile over Japan .	(3NSDBCr_1_23)
China , the North's main ally , has pushed for a " dual track approach " to the crisis which would see the United States freeze its military drills in South Korea while North Korea would halt its weapons programmes .	(3NSDBCr_1_24)
Washington has rejected that approach , and last week unveiled new sanctions targeting North Korean shipping , as well a number of Chinese companies doing business with the pariah state .	(3NSDBCr_1_25)
But the North responded defiantly , vowing to continue building up its nuclear force and warning that sanctions would never succeed .	(3NSDBCr_1_26)
Drumming up support for a tough stance against North Korea's nuclear weapons ambitions was the main focus of Trump's marathon tour of Asia earlier this month .	(3NSDBCr_1_27)

The missile was launched from Sain Ni , North Korea on Tuesday , and travelled about 1,000 km before splashing down in the Sea of Japan , within Japan's Economic Exclusion Zone .	(SNSSRao_1_4)

And as it does , it continues its march toward a functional nuclear arsenal , " Haley said .	(SNSSRao_1_14)
She said the development of North Korea's missile systems demanded that countries further isolate the regime of Kim Jong Un .	(SNSSRao_1_15)
" So today , we call on all nations to cut off all ties with North Korea .	(SNSSRao_1_16)
In addition to fully implementing all UN sanctions , all countries should sever diplomatic relations with North Korea and limit military , scientific , technical , or commercial cooperation .	(SNSSRao_1_17)
They must also cut off trade with the regime by stopping all imports and exports and expel all North Korean workers , " she demanded .	(SNSSRao_1_18)
The British Ambassador to the UN , Matthew Rycroft , said that the latest missile launch follows 19 previous launches this year , and North Korea's sixth nuclear test in September .	(SNSSRao_1_19)

Now Satyajit Ray's Prof Shonku to be adopted for film	(wNSSfK2_1_title)
Kolkata , Nov 30 ( PTI ) .	(wNSSfK2_1_1)
Satyajit Ray's famous science - fiction character Professor Shonku will now be adopted for big screen with Dhritiman Chatterjee essaying the role of the world famous fictional scientist visiting Brazil on some expedition .	(wNSSfK2_1_2)
Ray's son Sandip , who has already made a number of popular films on the versatile writer - director - illustrator father's fictional sleuth Feluda , told a press meet here last evening , " We will take up ' Nakur Babu O El Dorado ' one of the most gripping tales of Professor Shonku series as the first film which will be titled ' Professor Shonku o El Dorado ' .	(wNSSfK2_1_3)
" It will definitely be a film in science fiction genre having both Bengali and English dialogues depending on the nationality of characters and the places of occurrence as the shoots will take place in Kolkata and elsewhere in India and also in Brazil .	(wNSSfK2_1_4)
" Also Professor Shonku , an internationally recognised scientist , will certainly converse in English or other languages like Portuguese with his friends abroad and not in Bengali or Hindi , " Sandip Ray commented .	(wNSSfK2_1_5)
" We will ensure every detail is kept , including the way Professor Shonku's house is etched out in the fictional work of father , " he said adding there will be lots of special effects .	(wNSSfK2_1_6)
" Apart from Shonku and his private assistant Prahlad , there are many other characters of British , German , Brazilian nationalities in the work .	(wNSSfK2_1_7)
We have to think what will be their language .	(wNSSfK2_1_8)
We know the Brazilian film industry is big and would take actors from there when we visit the country , " he said .	(wNSSfK2_1_9)
The film will have lots of special effect but how the story will be told , ether in first person by Shonku's assistant Prahlad or in simple narrative form will be revealed later , he said to a question adding if the shooting in India and Brazil was over by July - August 2018 , they were aiming for a December release in 2018 .	(wNSSfK2_1_10)
Actor Dhritiman Chatterjee said , " Shonku is a character meant for an international audience , the audience who are based in Kolkata and also spread elsewhere in the world .	(wNSSfK2_1_11)
We are certainly trying to give a global flavour to the film and its characters . "	(wNSSfK2_1_12)
Asked about the reason behind casting Dhritiman as Shonku , Sandip said , " He fits in well from every point of view .	(wNSSfK2_1_13)
Shonku is not much tall , and we must remember an actor essaying Shonku has to be fluent in English . "	(wNSSfK2_1_14)
Sandip , who had kept the theme music in Feluda by retaining the signature tunes while reworking in contemporary mould , said " We are planning a track which will gel with the literary work . "	(wNSSfK2_1_15)
Srikant Mohta of SVF said , " It is a great moment for SVF .	(wNSSfK2_1_16)

Opener Murali Vijay cruised to an effortless half - century as India reached a comfortable 116 for two at lunch on the opening day of the third and final cricket Test , here today .	(mNSwIcf_1_2)
Vijay was batting on 51 while skipper Virat Kohli hit three fours in his 17 .	(mNSwIcf_1_3)
While the home team scored runs at a fast clip during the opening session , both Shikhar Dhawan ( 23 ) and Cheteshwar Pujara ( 23 ) would be lamenting the chance missed on one of the flattest decks on offer .	(mNSwIcf_1_4)
Sri Lankan skipper Dinesh Chandimal was spot on in his assessment of the track as it was another typical low bounce batting paradise at Kotla , where Vijay made merry from the word go after Kohli opted to bat .	(mNSwIcf_1_5)
Vijay started with a streaky four past gully off Suranga Lakmal followed by one off his hips .	(mNSwIcf_1_6)
In the next over from Lahiru Gamage , there was a firm jab past the bowler that went to the boundary .	(mNSwIcf_1_7)

It was off - spinner's 100th Test wicket .	(mNSwIcf_1_10)
Pujara was as watchful as he had been all these years before unleashing his range of strokes with the visiting team ? s bowling attack looking sub - standard .	(mNSwIcf_1_11)
The Lankan attack ? s plight could be gauged by the fact that they were hit for 18 boundaries in the first session .	(mNSwIcf_1_12)
However he fell to a trap when Chandimal deployed a leg slip for Pujara and Gamage fired one into his body .	(mNSwIcf_1_13)
Pujara tried to whip it off his hips but Sadeera Samarawickrama was positioned exactly for that catch .	(mNSwIcf_1_14)
However there was no stopping Vijay , who treated all bowlers with equal disdain .	(mNSwIcf_1_15)
He hit a flowing cover drive off Gamage and then flicked him through the vacant mid - wicket region for another boundary .	(mNSwIcf_1_16)
Vijay got to his 16th Test half - century off 67 balls when an overthrow fetched him five runs .	(mNSwIcf_1_17)

In Flynn , Mueller unearths more lies - and a key witness	(iNSx9Tb_1_title)
Washington , Dec 2 ( AP ) More smoke but no smoking gun .	(iNSx9Tb_1_1)
Michael Flynn's guilty plea added a new layer of lies to the far - reaching investigation into ties between President Donald Trump and Russia , and put heightened scrutiny on the president's son - in - law , Jared Kushner .	(iNSx9Tb_1_2)
But Flynn's admission , and all of the criminal cases thus far , have not resolved the fundamental question special counsel Robert Mueller is seeking to answer : Did Trump's campaign collude with Russia to win the election ?	(iNSx9Tb_1_3)
Still , Mueller has left no doubt that his investigators have amassed a wealth of knowledge about the contacts between Trump associates and the Russians , and they're looking to gather more facts from Flynn , a new key cooperator .	(iNSx9Tb_1_4)
By forcing Flynn's assistance , Mueller gains someone who can put him in the room with Trump and his closest advisers during the campaign , transition and the early days of the administration , times where Trump associates have acknowledged communicating with people connected to Russia .	(iNSx9Tb_1_5)
In the hours after Flynn admitted lying about his contacts with a Russian government official , two names surfaced as integral players in his actions .	(iNSx9Tb_1_6)
Kushner was identified as a " very senior " transition official , who directed Flynn to contact foreign governments , including Russia , about a UN Security Council resolution last December .	(iNSx9Tb_1_7)
And KT McFarland , who served as Flynn's deputy national security adviser , was a " senior " transition official involved in discussions with Flynn about what to relay to Sergey Kislyak , then Russia's ambassador to the US , about the response to US sanctions levied by the Obama administration .	(iNSx9Tb_1_8)
Kushner and McFarland weren't named in court papers .	(iNSx9Tb_1_9)
But McFarland's involvement was confirmed by two former transition officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorised to publicly discuss the matter .	(iNSx9Tb_1_10)
One of the officials confirmed Kushner's involvement .	(iNSx9Tb_1_11)
Flynn became the fourth person known to have been charged in Mueller's probe and the second , after former campaign policy adviser George Papadopoulos , to cooperate with investigators .	(iNSx9Tb_1_12)
For both Flynn and Papadopoulos , prosecutors employed a similar , and textbook , strategy by accepting a limited guilty plea and turning the defendants into government cooperators .	(iNSx9Tb_1_13)
Papadopoulos and Flynn both pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about their foreign contacts but not for their underlying conduct .	(iNSx9Tb_1_14)
Still , Flynn's plea to a single felony count of false statements made him the first official of the Trump White House to admit guilt so far in Mueller's criminal investigation as court papers made clear that senior Trump officials were aware of his outreach to Russian officials in the weeks before the inauguration .	(iNSx9Tb_1_15)
That revelation moved the Russia investigation , which has overshadowed Trump's agenda throughout the year , deeper into the White House and raised questions about the accuracy of administration assertions that Flynn had misled Vice President Mike Pence and other officials about his calls with Kislyak .	(iNSx9Tb_1_16)
Though prosecutors also had investigated Flynn lobbying work on behalf of the Turkish government , the fact he pleaded guilty to just one count , and faces a guideline range of zero to six months in prison , suggest prosecutors see him as a valuable tool and are granting a degree of leniency in exchange for his sharing what he knows .	(iNSx9Tb_1_17)
Flynn , a 58 - year - old retired US Army lieutenant general , accepted responsibility for his actions in a written statement : " My guilty plea and agreement to cooperate with the Special Counsel's Office reflect a decision I made in the best interests of my family and of our country . "	(iNSx9Tb_1_18)
Immediately after Flynn's plea , White House lawyer Ty Cobb sought to put distance between Trump and the ex - aide , saying , " Nothing about the guilty plea or the charge implicates anyone other than Mr Flynn . "	(iNSx9Tb_1_19)
For his part , the president ignored reporters ' shouted questions as he welcomed the Libyan prime minister to the White House , and aides cancelled media access to a later meeting between the two .	(iNSx9Tb_1_20)
He did appear briefly at an afternoon White House holiday reception for the media , where he offered season's greetings and departed without addressing the Mueller investigation .	(iNSx9Tb_1_21)
Trump grew close to Flynn during the campaign .	(iNSx9Tb_1_22)
The general was a vocal and reliable Trump surrogate , known for leading crowds in " Lock her up " chants regarding Democrat Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server .	(iNSx9Tb_1_23)
After his election victory , Trump elevated Flynn as his top national security adviser .	(iNSx9Tb_1_24)
But Flynn's White House tenure was short - lived .	(iNSx9Tb_1_25)
He was forced to resign last February following news reports revealing that the Obama administration officials had informed the Trump White House that Flynn had discussed sanctions with Kislyak , a fact at odds with the public assertions of Pence .	(iNSx9Tb_1_26)
The officials warned that the discrepancy made the administration potentially vulnerable to Russian blackmail .	(iNSx9Tb_1_27)
After Flynn's departure from the White House , Trump retained a special interest in his former adviser .	(iNSx9Tb_1_28)
Former FBI Director James Comey , whose firing in May precipitated the appointment of Mueller as special counsel , has said Trump asked him in a private Oval Office meeting to consider ending the investigation into Flynn .	(iNSx9Tb_1_29)
Comey has said he found the encounter so shocking that he prepared an internal memo about it .	(iNSx9Tb_1_30)
That FBI investigation was the basis of the court case against Flynn , centring on a series of conversations that Flynn had with Kislyak during the transition period between the November election and the January 20 inauguration .	(iNSx9Tb_1_31)
Prosecutors say Flynn on December 29 spoke with an unnamed senior transition team official about what , if anything , to say about sanctions that had been imposed on Russia one day earlier by the Obama administration in retaliation for election interference .	(iNSx9Tb_1_32)
Flynn requested the Russian ambassador " not escalate the situation " and respond " in a reciprocal manner , " a conversation prosecutors say he then reported to transition team members .	(iNSx9Tb_1_33)
Just days later , Vladimir Putin opted not to retaliate .	(iNSx9Tb_1_34)
Another conversation with Kislyak occurred one week earlier after a " very senior member " of the presidential transition team directed Flynn to contact foreign government officials , including from Russia , about a UN Security Council resolution regarding Israeli settlements .	(iNSx9Tb_1_35)
In a striking rupture with past practice , the Obama administration refrained from vetoing the condemnation of the settlement expansion , opting instead to abstain .	(iNSx9Tb_1_36)
The rest of the 15 - nation council , including Russia , voted unanimously against Israel .	(iNSx9Tb_1_37)
At the time , Israel was lobbying furiously against the resolution and the Trump team spoke up on behalf of the Jewish state .	(iNSx9Tb_1_38)
Former US officials and foreign diplomats said Kushner led the transition effort to defeat that UN vote .	(iNSx9Tb_1_39)
During his conversation with Kislyak , prosecutors say , Flynn requested that Russia vote against or delay the resolution , though he admitted in his plea deal that he later lied to the FBI by saying he had not made that request .	(iNSx9Tb_1_40)

Prohibitory orders are also in place , police said .	(ANT8y6J_1_4)
The district administration had permitted the organisers to take out the procession on a specified route , and informed those required , including public representatives , about it , they said .	(ANT8y6J_1_5)

In Patidar - dominated Amreli , farm issues take centre - stage	(CNTM6yT_1_title)
Amreli , Dec 4 ( PTI ) .	(CNTM6yT_1_1)
The Patidar - dominated Amreli is gearing up for a fight between two strong Patel candidates in the assembly segment , where farm issues are dominating the campaign discourse .	(CNTM6yT_1_2)
Sitting Congress MLA Paresh Dhanani is pitted against BJP heavyweight Bavkubhai Undhad , the legislator from the nearby Lathi seat who has been fielded from Amreli this time .	(CNTM6yT_1_3)
There is a talk in political circles here that Dhanani could emerge as a strong contender for the chief minister's post if he retains his seat and the Congress dislodges the BJP from power in Gandhinagar .	(CNTM6yT_1_4)
Dhanani , 41 , is considered close to Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi and had accompanied the latter during his campaign tours .	(CNTM6yT_1_5)
In the 2012 Assembly elections , Dhanani had registered a resounding victory - he won by a margin of more than 18 per cent votes over his nearest rival Dilip Sanghavi , a senior BJP leader and prominent cooperative leader .	(CNTM6yT_1_6)
The most important issue in this agriculture - dominated constituency , known for cotton cultivation , is farm distress , and the Congress seems to be cashing in on this .	(CNTM6yT_1_7)
The Patidars form 60 per cent of the population in the Amreli assembly segment followed by Kolis at 15 per cent .	(CNTM6yT_1_8)
Besides farm matters , issues like the impact of the Centre's demonetisation move and effects of GST on the diamond polishing industry are being raised aggressively by the candidates .	(CNTM6yT_1_9)
A section of farmers believes that the promises made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi regarding minimum support price ( MSP ) for farm produce and tackling issues related to agriculture have not been fulfilled .	(CNTM6yT_1_10)
" Modiji had promised us ( MSP of ) Rs 2,000 per 20 kg on cotton against Rs 1,500 given by the UPA government .	(CNTM6yT_1_11)
But we are getting Rs 800 - 900 , which is causing us a huge loss .	(CNTM6yT_1_12)
Many of us have not got crop insurance money , " said a cotton farmer , Pankaj Chavda .	(CNTM6yT_1_13)
Chavda added that the PM's pre - Lok Sabha election promise of giving farmers a support price that is 50 per cent more than production cost of a crop , too , remains a pipe dream .	(CNTM6yT_1_14)
In Amreli , where farmers mainly grow cotton , the crop has seen a sharp decline in prices this year , fuelling anger against the state government .	(CNTM6yT_1_15)
Amreli district Congress president Pankaj Kanabar said Chief Minister Vijay Rupani recently announced his government would purchase cotton at Rs 100 per 20 kg over and above the MSP .	(CNTM6yT_1_16)
However , Kanabar alleged only the farmers who were close to the BJP were getting this benefit .	(CNTM6yT_1_17)
" It is a scam in which BJP's commission agents have made a lot of money while genuine farmers have been left out , " he said .	(CNTM6yT_1_18)
The BJP candidate Undhad is trying to douse the anger of the Patidars against the ruling party by listing the efforts made by the Rupani government to address the grievances of the community .	(CNTM6yT_1_19)
Patidar quota stir spearhead Hardik Patel is expected to address an election rally in Amreli on December 6 .	(CNTM6yT_1_20)
Undhad is battling the image of a politician who has switched sides .	(CNTM6yT_1_21)
He started out as a BJP leader and later joined the Congress and became its MLA from Lathi in 2012 .	(CNTM6yT_1_22)
He came back to the BJP fold in 2014 and was made a minister .	(CNTM6yT_1_23)
The BJP said it is on a strong wicket in Amreli as its candidate has developed strong links with the constituency , while the sitting MLA is hardly seen here .	(CNTM6yT_1_24)
" The BJP is strong because Bavkubhai lives here most of the time , while Congress candidate Paresh Dhanani mostly remains outside the constituency and is rarely seen here , " said district BJP president Hiren Hilpara .	(CNTM6yT_1_25)
" As far as farmer issues are concerned , we are making sure all farmers get higher rate than MSP for their produce .	(CNTM6yT_1_26)
The government is making purchases of groundnut and cotton which will continue till March next year , " he said .	(CNTM6yT_1_27)
Voting in Amreli will take place on December 9 .	(CNTM6yT_1_28)
There are a total of nine candidates in the fray , including four independents , but the fight is likely to be between Dhanani and Undhad .	(CNTM6yT_1_29)
The NCP and the BSP have also fielded their nominees .	(CNTM6yT_1_30)

Naidu stressed that people should never forget their mother - tongue and motherland and cited examples of head of governments of Russia , France , China who mostly speak their own language while visiting India , saying " it does not mean that they do not know English " .	(hNTMw-i_1_6)
" I'm not against English but if we communicate in our mother - tongue it is always better , " he said .	(hNTMw-i_1_7)
" Nationalism means respect to all .	(hNTMw-i_1_8)
Namaskar is the culture of India , similarly Vande Matram means salute to the motherland , " the vice president said .	(hNTMw-i_1_9)
He said if democracy meant independence it also meant complying with the rules and that difference of opinion was okay but the efforts to destabilise the country should never be allowed to succeed .	(hNTMw-i_1_10)
He emphasised on the importance of teachers , saying children these days are dependent on Google , which was a good source of information , but , he said , it could never take the place of teachers .	(hNTMw-i_1_11)

New Delhi , Dec 9 ( PTI ) .	(hNUSB9u_1_1)

Israel strikes kill two in Gaza as Trump rage simmers	(aNUSqS4_1_title)
Gaza City , Dec 9 ( AFP ) .	(aNUSqS4_1_1)
Retaliatory Israeli air strikes on the Gaza Strip killed two Hamas militants today , as unrest simmered across the Palestinian territories over US President Donald Trump's declaration of Jerusalem as Israel's capital .	(aNUSqS4_1_2)
A total of four people have now been killed and dozens wounded since Trump announced his deeply controversial decision which drew criticism from every other member of the UN Security Council at an emergency meeting yesterday .	(aNUSqS4_1_3)
There were fresh clashes on Saturday as Palestinian protesters in the occupied West Bank hurled stones at Israeli troops who responded with tear gas , rubber bullets and live rounds .	(aNUSqS4_1_4)
In Gaza , mourners vented their anger at the funeral of one of two people killed by Israeli troops during clashes at the border fence yesterday .	(aNUSqS4_1_5)
There have been fears of a much larger escalation of violence after Hamas leader Ismail Haniya called for a new Palestinian intifada or uprising and analysts have been anxiously watching what happens next .	(aNUSqS4_1_6)
Dozens of protesters were wounded by rubber bullets or live fire in clashes in the occupied West Bank , Gaza Strip and Jerusalem that followed the main weekly Muslim prayers yesterday .	(aNUSqS4_1_7)
Tens of thousands also protested in Muslim and Arab countries , including Jordan , Turkey , Pakistan and Malaysia .	(aNUSqS4_1_8)
Today's pre - dawn air strike on a base of Hamas's military wing in Nusseirat , in the central Gaza Strip , was one of several , the Israeli military said .	(aNUSqS4_1_9)
It followed three rocket attacks Friday night from Gaza into southern Israel .	(aNUSqS4_1_10)
" Today . . . in response to the rockets fired at southern Israeli communities throughout yesterday , Israel air force aircraft targeted four facilities belonging to the Hamas terror organisation in the Gaza Strip , " the army said .	(aNUSqS4_1_11)
It said the targets were " two weapons manufacturing sites , a weapons warehouse and a military compound , in each target , several components were hit , " it added .	(aNUSqS4_1_12)
The Hamas health ministry in Gaza said the two dead men were members of its armed wing , which has fought three wars with Israel since 2008 .	(aNUSqS4_1_13)
Last night , a rocket hit the southern Israeli city of Sderot although Israeli public radio said it did not explode and did not cause any casualties .	(aNUSqS4_1_14)
The Israeli military said that its Iron Dome air defence system intercepted an earlier rocket fired from the Palestinian enclave .	(aNUSqS4_1_15)
It said it later detected a second missile launch , but had not found evidence that it had reached Israeli territory .	(aNUSqS4_1_16)
The military retaliated last night with air strikes on what it said were two targets and the Gaza health ministry said 14 people were wounded , among them women and children .	(aNUSqS4_1_17)
A previously unknown Salafist group calling itself the Salahedin Brigades claimed responsibility for one of the attacks .	(aNUSqS4_1_18)
But the Israeli army said it held Hamas responsible for all " hostile activity " originating from the territory under its control .	(aNUSqS4_1_19)
Trump's decision drew lavish praise from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu but has sparked a worldwide diplomatic backlash .	(aNUSqS4_1_20)
Five European countries on the UN Security Council insisted the new US policy was not consistent with past resolutions , including one that declares east Jerusalem to be Israeli - occupied .	(aNUSqS4_1_21)
The meeting was requested by eight of the 15 members of the council but was largely symbolic as no vote on a resolution was planned because the US wields veto power .	(aNUSqS4_1_22)
Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas hailed the international concern .	(aNUSqS4_1_23)
The Israeli army said around 4,500 Palestinians " participated in violent riots " along the Gaza - Israel border .	(aNUSqS4_1_24)
It said that troops shot at " dozens " of what it said were ringleaders of the disturbances .	(aNUSqS4_1_25)
In the West Bank , thousands of Palestinians took part in " violent riots " throughout the territory , with 28 arrested and about 65 wounded , the army said .	(aNUSqS4_1_26)
Trump said his defiant move - making good on a 2016 presidential campaign pledge - marked the start of a " new approach " to solving the Israeli - Palestinian conflict .	(aNUSqS4_1_27)
But many analysts question how a balanced agreement can be reached by granting such a major Israeli demand before negotiations have even started .	(aNUSqS4_1_28)
Israel has long claimed all of Jerusalem as its indivisible capital , while the Palestinians see the annexed eastern sector of the city as the capital of their future state .	(aNUSqS4_1_29)
Its status is the most sensitive issue in the decades - long conflict .	(aNUSqS4_1_30)

Sterilisation failure by govt clinic : Woman moves HC for compensation	(VNUcHDm_1_title)
New Delhi , Dec 10 ( PTI ) .	(VNUcHDm_1_1)
A 28 - year - old mother of four has moved the Delhi High Court seeking compensation from the Delhi government for the failure of a parivar seva clinic run by it to sterilise her , leading to her fourth pregnancy .	(VNUcHDm_1_2)
The petition , which seeks implementation of the Centre's Family Planning Indemnity Scheme , was listed for hearing in the court of Justice Vibhu Bakhru on Friday .	(VNUcHDm_1_3)
Since Justice Bakhru was not available on that day , the woman's plea has been listed for hearing on January 16 .	(VNUcHDm_1_4)
According to the woman's plea , filed through advocate Sija Nair Pal , she underwent the sterilisation procedure on August 9 , last year .	(VNUcHDm_1_5)
However , in May when she went to the clinic for a check up it was found that she was 14 weeks pregnant , the plea said .	(VNUcHDm_1_6)
She alleged that the clinic did not provide her with any " pre or post - sterilisation counselling about the procedure , potential risks or post - surgery care or possibility of failure " .	(VNUcHDm_1_7)
She has contended in her plea that the Standards of Male and Female Sterilisation Services 2006 of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare " clearly state that a client who becomes pregnant after the surgery should be offered medical termination of her pregnancy and repeat sterilisation surgery or should be medically supported throughout the pregnancy if she so wishes " .	(VNUcHDm_1_8)
" The respondents ( Delhi government , its health department and the clinic ) , however , did not offer any medical support to the petitioner throughout the pregnancy , " the plea said , adding that the clinic offered to carry out an abortion for Rs 3,000 .	(VNUcHDm_1_9)

Mehsana gives BJP the jitters , discontent even in PM hometown	(ANUch2y_1_title)
Mehsana / Vadnagar ( Gujarat ) , Dec 10 ( PTI ) .	(ANUch2y_1_1)
It's not every day that you find a hardened BJP worker muttering under his breath that his party , which has been ruling Gujarat for the last 22 years , is on a sticky wicket .	(ANUch2y_1_2)
When you do find one , that too in Vadnagar , Prime Minister Narendra Modi's home town , it is indicative of the discontent in parts of the state , where the BJP is aiming at returning to power for a fifth consecutive term .	(ANUch2y_1_3)
Dikshit Patel , a long time BJP worker , is worried that the simmering anger of the Patidar community , upset over the violence in 2015 during the agitation for reservation , could brim over on election day , spelling trouble for the party .	(ANUch2y_1_4)
He is not the only one viewing the December 14 election with foreboding .	(ANUch2y_1_5)
The mood in the BJP camp in Mehsana district , which straddles seven constituencies , is tense .	(ANUch2y_1_6)
Mehsana and Vadnagar fall in Mehsana district , but while Vadnagar is under the Unjha constituency , Mehsana city ( known as Mahesana in the list of the state election office ) is a separate constituency .	(ANUch2y_1_7)
BJP workers are apprehensive that the Patidar rage could severely dent the party's prospects .	(ANUch2y_1_8)
It all began in Mehsana , the epicentre of the Patidar agitation led by Patidar Amanat Andolan Samiti ( PAAS ) chief Hardik Patel , two years ago , they recall .	(ANUch2y_1_9)
The agitation for reservation took a violent turn , people were killed , Patidar leaders were jailed and the state was deaf to their demand for quota for the community .	(ANUch2y_1_10)
Today , the fire may have been doused but the embers still glow .	(ANUch2y_1_11)
" More than Hardik as an individual , it is the issue of Patidar reservation that has struck a chord with the Patels , especially the youth .	(ANUch2y_1_12)
Patels are the backbone of the BJP in Gujarat .	(ANUch2y_1_13)
We made the party what it is today so it is natural that if they desert our camp , the impact will be deep , " says Dikshit .	(ANUch2y_1_14)
Most BJP functionaries in the area , dominated by Patidars , belong to this community .	(ANUch2y_1_15)
But be it Dikshit in Vadnagar or Falgun Patel in Mehsana city , a fairly developed urban settlement , the anxiety is palpable .	(ANUch2y_1_16)
The party is trying to contain the potential damage in Unjha by playing up the fact that Narayanbhai Patel , the local MLA seeking a sixth - straight term , heads the Umiya Dham Temple , revered by the Patel community .	(ANUch2y_1_17)
He is up against the Congress ? s Ashaben Patel .	(ANUch2y_1_18)
The BJP has fielded Deputy Chief Minister Nitinbhai Patel against Jivabhai Patel of the Congress in Mahesana .	(ANUch2y_1_19)
Falgun Patel , who has been a corporator of the BJP in the local Mehsana municipality , also concedes that the contest is extremely tight because of the anger in the Patel community , which he says " cannot be bought " .	(ANUch2y_1_20)
He rattles off a set of figures to prove his point .	(ANUch2y_1_21)
" There are around 2.57 lakh voters in the Mahesana seat , out of which about 52,000 are Patidars .	(ANUch2y_1_22)
Among the Patidars , even considering the best possible scenario , not more than 18,000 shall vote for us .	(ANUch2y_1_23)
And Patels have been our strength , " Falgun says .	(ANUch2y_1_24)
He adds that the party is attempting to offset the Patel desertion by focusing more on OBC communities such as Thakores ( around 40,000 ) , Prajapatis ( 26,000 approx ) and the Chaudharys ( 17,000 approx ) .	(ANUch2y_1_25)
" Thakore votes are usually reserved for the Congress .	(ANUch2y_1_26)
But this time , we are hoping the OBCs will tilt towards the BJP considering the Congress's emphasis on wooing the Patidars by promising them reservation .	(ANUch2y_1_27)
The OBCs understand they stand to lose if the quotas materialise , " he explains .	(ANUch2y_1_28)
Not everyone is downcast , though .	(ANUch2y_1_29)
J K Bharot , 73 , who runs a stationery shop off the Mehsana - Palanpur highway , is as optimistic as ever .	(ANUch2y_1_30)
" Like I was when A K Patel was elected in 1984 .	(ANUch2y_1_31)
The Modi magic will work again , " he says , stressing repeatedly that the prime minister " is a great man " .	(ANUch2y_1_32)
A K Patel was the first BJP leader elected to the Lok Sabha from the Mehsana parliamentary constituency .	(ANUch2y_1_33)
He held the seat till 1998 , before Aatmaram Patel of the Congress took over and later , in 2004 , Jivabhai Patel .	(ANUch2y_1_34)
Vitthal Bhai Choudhary , a local BJP worker , echoes Bharot and says Falgun's assessment is needlessly pessimistic .	(ANUch2y_1_35)
A number of influential NRI Patels have arrived and are working overtime to win back the support of the disgruntled Patels , he says .	(ANUch2y_1_36)
Besides Unjha and Mahesana , the five other constituencies in the district are Kheralu , Visnagar and Becharaji , Kadi ( reserved for SCs ) and Vijapur .	(ANUch2y_1_37)
Other than Kadi and Vijapur , the rest are with the BJP .	(ANUch2y_1_38)
While the first polls were held on December 9 , these constituencies will vote in the second phase on December 14 .	(ANUch2y_1_39)
The results will be declared on December 18 .	(ANUch2y_1_40)
